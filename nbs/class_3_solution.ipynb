However, instead of trying to classify the sentiment of a text, we will be classifying whether texts are toxic or not. We are using the toxi-text dataset from huggingface.

       " 'This was my column, as approved by my editor, that the Courant refused to publish about one of its biggest advertisers. It was scheduled to run on Aug. 2 but was held without an explanation. This was the first time in my 40 years at The Courant that an investigation by the attorney general was withheld from the public.\\n\\nState Attorney General Richard Blumenthal says he has launched an investigation into consumer complaints that Sleepyâ€™s sold mattresses or box springs that were used instead of new, and in one case infested with bedbugs.\\n\\nBlumenthal said last month that he has up to 10 recent complaints against Sleepyâ€™s, the largest mattress chain in the United States, with 74 stores in Connecticut.\\n\\nA letter from Adam S. Blank, Sleepyâ€™s general counsel and chief operating officer. Please click here. A letter from Stern Environmental Group to Sleepy’s customer Jeff Maier. Please click here.\\n\\nâ€œWe have received a number of complaints, up to 10, that mattresses maybe have been used, with groves and deep depressions,â€\\x9d Blumenthal said in an interview with me.\\n\\nPrior to that interview I asked Blumenthal to check to see whether any other mattress retailers had complaints filed against them of giving customers used mattresses or of bed bug infestation.\\n\\nâ€œSleepyâ€™s was the only oneâ€\\x9d the attorney general replied.\\n\\nSleepyâ€™s denies it has ever sold a used mattress and says its inspection and quality control process would make it impossible for someone to receive a product infested with bedbugs. It says there has never been a proven case of bedbug infestations caused by their merchandise.\\n\\nSleepyâ€™s, with 700 stores nationwide, says that the number of complaints against it is tiny compared to the hundreds of thousands of mattresses the company sells each year. And almost all of the complaints were resolved.\\n\\nBlumenthalâ€™s investigation into Sleepyâ€™s operations is the second in Connecticut since 2004 when the company paid a $4,000 fine to consumer protection.\\n\\nTwo years ago Sleepyâ€™s, according to the Better Business Bureau, paid a $200,000 fine to New York City consumer officials as part of a settlement.\\n\\nThe BBB said that the company faced charges that it used â€œdeceptive sales tactics, including exchanging defective mattresses with equally defective mattresses; charging additional delivery fees to consumers for exchanging damaged mattresses; failing to deliver items when scheduled and not properly informing or offering customers store credit or refund; and refusing to honor manufacturer warranties because of alleged stains.\\n\\nJeff Maier, a Norwalk small businessman, asked Blumenthal to investigate Sleepyâ€™s last December because he and his wife had a â€˜â€™severeâ€™â€™ bedbug infestation that Maier said was the result of buying what appeared to be a used box spring from the Stamford Sleepyâ€™s store.\\n\\nOne week after receiving the box spring, Maier said in a telephone interview, his wife began developing red spots, which Maier said came from bedbugs.\\n\\nHe said they hired the Stern Environmental Group of Secaucus, N.J. to investigate and to exterminate the bugs. The company â€“ which specializes in ridding homes of bedbugs – dismantled the box spring and determined that it was the cause of the infestation, Maier said.\\n\\nStern Environmental Groupâ€™s report, made available to me, states that the â€œbox spring … was the culprit. There were bedbugs inside and the box spring did not look like it was new.â€\\x9d\\n\\nMaier said it took two months before all the bedbugs could be killed. (During that time, he told me, he and his wife had to stay in their bed because if they slept somewhere else the bedbugs would have moved with them.)\\n\\nHe said Sleepyâ€™s attorneys offered a replacement box spring, but they denied that the bedbugs came from their merchandise.\\n\\nMaier said he was suspicious when the delivery was made because the heavy plastic used to seal the box spring appeared to have been opened. He said one of the workers assured him that it was opened by them as they took it out of their truck.\\n\\nMaier said there is no other explanation for the bedbug infestation. The couple had not slept anywhere else in the weeks prior to their purchase, Maier said, and their personal habits had not changed.\\n\\nAdam S. Blank, Sleepyâ€™s general counsel and chief operating officer, said last month Sleepyâ€™s was unaware of Blumenthalâ€™s investigation and said bedbugs do not originate in beds, but come from people.\\n\\nIf Sleepyâ€™s had delivered a box spring to Maier that contained bedbugs, all the other merchandise on the truck would have also had bedbugs, he wrote in a five-page response to my questions.\\n\\nâ€œSleepyâ€™s does not now, has never, and will never, sell a used mattress. Any claim to the contrary we find to be defamatory,â€\\x9d wrote Blank.\\n\\nThe BBB report state that in the past three years, 633 complaints were filed against Sleepyâ€™s 700 stores (no state-by-state breakdown available).\\n\\nBBB statistics show that complaints grew yearly in the following areas: warranty issues, product issues, refund or exchange issues, selling practices and delivery issues.\\n\\nâ€œComplaints to the BBB have alleged failure to provide timely delivery; failure to honor warranties and guarantees; credit and billing disputes; and poor product quality. This firm has failed to eliminate the underlying cause of complaints brought to its attention by the Bureau,â€\\x9d the bureau reports on its web site.\\n\\nBetter Bedding, with nine stores in Connecticut and now in reorganization in Bankruptcy Court, has had four complaints with the BBB in the past three years and still has its top rating of A+.\\n\\nIn 2002 Sleepyâ€™s paid a $4,000 fine to Connecticut consumer officials as part of a settlement into complaints the company delivered mattresses in the middle of night and delivered defective merchandise, and a complaint that used merchandise may have been sold as new. In all four cases, Sleepyâ€™s did not admit to any wrongdoing, which is common in out-of-court settlements.\\n\\nThe report from Stern, Sleepyâ€™s complete response, the 2002 Connecticut settlement details, and the BBB reports, as well as details of the four settlements will be published on this blog.\\n\\nSimilar Posts:',\n",

       " 'Tag Archives: Batman & Robin\\n\\nFollowing the piracy of \"Batman\" #17 in advance of its release date earlier this week, DC Comics has another leak on its hands. A photo of variant covers for \"Batman, Incorporated\" #8 has surfaced, nearly two weeks prior to the comic\\'s February 27 release date. The photo shows three variant covers homaging Grant Morrison\\'s \"Batman: R.I.P.,\" with Damian Wayne\\'s Robin standing in for his father, the Dark Knight. Additionally, the letters \"R.I.P.\" appear at the bottom, using Robin\\'s \"R\" icon, revealing a major spoiler for Morrison\\'s upcoming \"Batman, Incorporated\" arc, which has been kept under tight wraps by DC. Damian\\'s death as the focus of Morrison\\'s newest arc has been a popular theory on Internet message boards, as Damian is nowhere to be found on the covers for May\\'s Batman-related issues, even on the cover of \"Batman and Robin\" #19.\\n\\nWhen approached by CBR News about the leak, DC representatives replied, \"No comment.\"\\n\\n\"Batman Incorporated\" #8 is far enough from its release date that retailers shouldn\\'t have received copies from Diamond yet. Retailers who opt-in to Diamond\\'s early delivery typically receive issues on the Tuesday before release, which makes how Mega obtained the issues somewhat of a mystery. Timing-wise, the leak syncs with the \"Amazing Spider-Man\" #700 leak last year, when scans of the issue popped up online 12 days early, exactly the same amount of time before the issue was scheduled for release.\\n\\n\"It\\'s always disappointing when someone decides to spoil a big story by posting it on the torrents,\" Alonso told CBR. \"Piracy affects fans, creators and retailers who look forward to a big comic book to put some cash in their registers — which \\'Amazing Spider-Man #700\\' definitely will do.

Well if you picked up the issue when it hit stores this past Wednesday, you now know exactly what we were talking about!\\n\\nIn JUSTICE LEAGUE #14, the League continues their battle against the Cheetah and Superman, while simultaneously trying to protect the Man of Steel from the wounds inflicted upon him. Deep in the forest, they meet the tribe that the Cheetah was meant to protect. The head of this tribe details the long history of the Cheetah and reveals that the root of the problem is not that the Goddess of the Hunt is evil. Instead, it’s the woman possessed by her who is!\\n\\nAfter being captured by the tribe, Superman is cured, and Cheetah gets locked away in Belle Reve. But once behind bars, the villainess begins to talk to an unseen source, revealing that her imprisonment was all part of a larger and mysterious plan. Meanwhile, on the Watchtower, the League tells Diana that Barbara Minerva is a lie. She is actually a wanted criminal who continues to switch identities to escape the authorities. Hurt by this news about the woman she once called her best friend, Wonder Woman seeks comfort in the Man of Steel.\\n\\nMuch to the surprise of the local customers, Superman takes Wonder Woman to the Smallville Diner in an attempt to help her regain some incentive to be the superhero that she is. Afterwards, he takes her on a tour of the Kent family farm and the duo share another passionate kiss.\\n\\nLittle do these lovebirds know, someone is watching their every move! It’s their teammate, Batman. And judging by the look on his face, he seems less than thrilled about his friends’ developing romance. How will the Dark Knight’s knowledge of Wonder Woman and Superman’s relationship impact it? And more importantly, what will this mean for the Justice League itself? Place your bets in the comments section!\\n\\nBelow, take a look at the final pages of “The Secret of the Cheetah” as Superman and Wonder Woman kiss under the watchful eye of Batman.

Room 4\\n\\nOn the long list of DC Comics\\' villains and super villains, the Joker is undoubtedly one of the publisher\\'s best-known antagonists. An iconic Batman bad guy who has appeared in comics, film, TV, video games and pretty much any type of media featuring the Caped Crusader, \"Batman\" writer Scott Snyder finally takes his long-awaited shot at writing Gotham\\'s maniacal clown in a new October-launching story arc titled \"Death Of The Family.\"\\n\\nThe Joker debuted in 1940 in the pages of \"Batman\" #1, beginning his 70-odd year life as a criminal psychopath and one of Batman\\'s most dangerous archenemies. In the relaunched New 52 DC Universe, the Joker was first and last seen in writer/artist Tony Daniels\\' \"Detective Comics\" #1, getting a face lift from the villain the Dollmaker — quite literally, as Dollmaker peeled Joker\\'s entire face off and tacked it to the wall.\\n\\nMysteriously and noticably absent since that issue, Snyder\\'s \"Death Of The Family,\" drawn by regular \"Batman\" artist Greg Capullo, will be the first to touch on the character fully since last September as the Joker returns, gunning for Batman and all the Bat allies.\\n\\nAmidst all the buzz surrounding the recently announced storyline, CBR spoke directly with Snyder about his new story, how Joker will look sans-face, and the Joker crossover brewing among the rest of the Bat books.',\n",

       " 'For the sake of Vancouver Canucks fans’ sanity, let’s assume that the unfortunate result of Jesperi Kotkaniemi holding Elias Pettersson behind the play and falling awkwardly on his leg leads to a much more minor injury than it looked like initially, and Pettersson can get back into games before we know it.\\n\\nThe Canucks will need their rookie phenom to continue to be in top form if they have any hope of making the playoffs this year. At this stage of the season, I don’t think I was alone in thinking the Canucks would be much further out of the picture, but the team has rallied around the transcendent performance of Pettersson and sit just one point behind the Anaheim Ducks for the second wild card spot in the West.\\n\\nStream Canucks hockey on Sportsnet NOW Sportsnet NOW gives you access to over 500 NHL games this season, blackout-free, including Hockey Night in Canada, Rogers Hometown Hockey, Scotiabank Wednesday Night Hockey, the entire 2019 Stanley Cup Playoffs and more.\\n\\nThe one wrench in the gears outside of Pettersson’s injury is that the Canucks have played more games than every other team they’re within four points of, and the team that’s the most dangerous to them in Minnesota has a whopping five games in hand.\\n\\nSo the question becomes how likely is it that Vancouver can squeeze its way into one of those wild card spots? Let’s look at how the Canucks compare to the teams that are within plus or minus four points of them the standings.\\n\\nExamining the statistics at 5-vs-5 on a team-wide perspective, things don’t look too great for the Canucks. They’re outplayed by their opponents in each of the major categories that lead to goal scoring. Specifically, the Canucks are weakest at manufacturing and preventing quality chances, both in terms of shot locations and puck movement.\\n\\nThe good news for the Canucks is that three of these teams can make the cut, and of this group they’re currently third in the tiebreaker (regulation or overtime wins with 19, tied with Minnesota). However, that’s about the only bit of good news.\\n\\nJacob Markstrom has had a strong season for a team that isn’t amazing defensively, but of this group, he’s only putting up a better save percentage than one team’s starting goalie — Edmonton’s Cam Talbot, who has been giving up more and more of the net to Mikko Koskinen. Koskinen has also been stronger than Markstrom so far.\\n\\nTop prospect Thatcher Demko could add depth in goal for the Canucks, giving them more chances to win games that may have previously felt like schedule losses. Even if they start getting better goaltending, their play at 5-vs-5 has to improve if they’re going to not only pass one of the teams ahead of them, but avoid being leapfrogged by Minnesota as the season wears on.\\n\\nOf the teams currently in a playoff spot, the Anaheim Ducks look to be the most vulnerable, despite the fact they’re getting fewer than 40 per cent of the high danger chances in their games. They have John Gibson stopping 92.5 per cent of the shots he faces papering over their weaknesses.\\n\\nDallas is the other team that looks a little vulnerable, and much like the Ducks they’re being carried by great goaltending, with Ben Bishop stopping 92.3 per cent of everything he’s seen this season.\\n\\n31 Thoughts: The Podcast Jeff Marek and Elliotte Friedman talk to a lot of people around the hockey world, and then they tell listeners all about what they’ve heard and what they think about it.\\n\\nLooking at special teams doesn’t exactly bode well for the Canucks either, as they’re among the bottom-10 teams in the league at creating scoring chances on the power play. They also shoot from outside the slot more than league average.\\n\\nVancouver does have a very effective penalty kill, preventing scoring chances overall like a top-10 team, while limiting high danger chances like a top-five team. That’s something to build on, but hockey goes both ways; you have to prevent goals and score them.\\n\\nThe Pettersson effect has been enough to get them this far, but getting over the hump and into the playoffs is a bigger challenge than simply being almost there. Both the standings and the statistics are stacked against them this season, and while playoff fever may be a tempting feeling for Vancouver to capture once again, I don’t think it would be a bad thing necessarily for this group to just miss out on the postseason.\\n\\nRemember that in September this team was expected to be among the worst in the league. Now, all these young players have realized the team is better initially projected and can play well enough to get close to the playoffs. That lesson, along with a better draft pick, is not such a bad consolation prize if the Canucks can’t pull it off.\\n\\nThis is clearly a team on the rise, but they don’t look like they’re quite at playoff level yet.',\n",

Had tae make a slight exception here because this is an interview with Kenny Williams, and Kenny is the fuckin bollocks. No question. Kenny is one of the fastest rising stars in Scottish Wrestling, and a fan favourite everywhere he goes because he gets it. He knows what folk want from a wrestling show. They want entertainment. They want cunts knocking their pan in to provide that entertainment, and some of them even want the guys providing said entertainment to have more product in their hair than a burd in a beauty pageant. Kenny Williams has it all. When he first debuted alongside Christopher in ICW, my first thought was “aww whit, ANOTHER one of these wee fannies?” but we soon seen Kenny was nae joke. Him and Christopher’s match with the NAK at ICWs Maryhill show was when most of us realised Kenny was legit. Kenny is the bollocks.\\n\\nThe bollocks took some time out of his busy schedule of being a globetrotting professional sha….I mean wrestler, to answer a few questions for his pals at Snapmare Necks (thats us btw) so you should probably go right ahead and read that shit. Its waiting for ye. Down there. See it? Just below this? Thats the one. In amongst it.\\n\\n1. You’re one of the newer faces in Scottish Wrestling, can you tell us a bit about how you got started and who/what influenced your decision to give wrestling a go?\\n\\nGenerally I’ve always loved the ‘Rasslin! But it wasn’t untill I was about 18 that I decided to give it a go. I had gotten into Law at university straight from school but I only last about 6 weeks as I realised it just wasn’t what I wanted to do with my life. I fannyed about for a few months after that and at the beginning of 2012 I decided to give something that I had always loved a bash. I searched about for local schools and luckily a PBW Academy had just opened in the area that I love of Airdrie. I’ve been hooked ever since then!\\n\\n2. The “Kenny is the bollocks” chant at ICW has been going for a while, with your popularity in the company seemingly sky high. How much do you enjoy working in front of those wild crowds, particularly when they seem to have taken you to their hearts so quickly?\\n\\nI find it ridiculous anytime that chant starts up when I come out. It’s so humbling and overwhelming and I appreciate who ever started it because I’m hopefully going to sell lots of t-shirts with that printed on it! Working for ICW is a tremendous experience and I’ve been so lucky with the situations that have arisen for me. Being part of Team CK the fans never really got to see the full potential that we had as a duo and so when Christopher decided to call it a day I was disheartened by it all. However, when I finally got a chance to showcase what I could do in the ring on a singles level, with one of the best in the country, Lionheart, that’s when it felt like everything clicked with the fans. They didn’t just see some wee guy with a quiff and pair of skinny jeans. They saw a wee guy with a quiff and skinny jeans that had a bit of fight and determination in him. Since then I’ve been riding on a wave of momentum that the fans have created with this chant! And I’m so grateful to every person who starts that up when I walk out with those dafties in the Kennedy Administration!\\n\\n3. You’re part of a stable with a bit of everything at the moment with the “Kennedy Administration” in ICW, how much are you enjoying being involved in that? And with you not getting on particularly well with your stable mates, are there any plans in place to toe their baws any time soon?\\n\\nI’m finding it really fun because it’s a different dynamic than any of the other factions in ICW as it’s a heel group with a fan favourite trapped in it. And luckily/unluckily I’m that fan favourite so it’s funny to see how harshly the fans react to James R Kennedy when he starts hurling abuse at me. The fans anticipation for me to finally skud one of them is definitely growing but its like being caught between a rock and a hard place as I can’t risk having my contract terminated by Kennedy.\\n\\n4. You recently made your debut for SWA, in a belter of a match against Lewis Girvan, and you’re a regular with PBW. How do you enjoy the family friendly shows compared to the adult orientated ones?\\n\\nDespite the obvious differences in content of the shows, I feel that working any wrestling show the fans are all there for the same reason, to see top quality wrestling that Scotland has become a custom to. So I enjoy the two types equally because I’m getting to do what I love to do and if I’m doing it well I’m hopefully entertaining the fans who have made the effort to come out and support their local wrestling promotion.\\n\\n5. Do you have a match that you’d rank as your best so far?\\n\\nI’m to critical of myself to cite a best match so instead ill list some favourites and plug some of the youtube footage I have\\nPBW- vs Zack Sabre Jr.. A match that came out of pure circumstance and I was a last-minute substitute. Working Zack was a ridiculous experience as he is just a different class of performer.\\n\\nPBW – Kenny Williams vs Zack Sabre Jr\\n\\nPBW – vs Liam Thompson… Got to main event in my hometown and fool friends and family into thinking I had won the title. Was a crazy atmosphere and by far one of my favourite nights in wrestling\\n\\nPBW – Liam Thomson vs Kenny Williams (PBW Title Match)\\n\\nICW – vs Lionheart… Like I said this match really helped establish me as a singles competitor and a fan favourite and it took a lot of folk by surprise.\\nBCW – vs Kid Fite… Got to main event a show with a guy who was a major part of my training so it meant a lot to me. Also happened to be a year after I debuted so it was full of sentimentalities!\\n\\n(Not the match Kenny mentioned, as its been taken off youtube, but still a cracker of a match between these two)\\n\\nSSW – Kid Fite vs Kenny Williams\\n\\n6. Favourite wrestler? Either currently or all-time…or both if ye fancy.\\n\\nCurrently my favourite wrestler would have to be Bray Wyatt. He’s so captivating, it’s like watching a scene from a movie when he cuts a promo and his matches are always so different from what’s going on in the rest of the show. Of all time it has to be Shawn Michaels. I got into wrestling when he came back all born again and drug free so I got HBK when he was at his healthiest and churning out some of his best matches.\\n\\n7. You’re confirmed for ICWs latest project, a show mainly geared towards the younger talents called “Spacebaws – A New Hope”. Are you excited to play a prominent role on this show?\\n\\nI have no idea what I’ll be doing on this show I have to admit. I’m on the poster so I’m on the show! I can assure you though this will be a night not to miss! Cramming a show full of hungry young talent in an over 18s environment is a recipe for mayhem because there will be a level of one up manship between every person on that show to prove to Mark Dallas why they deserve to be part of ICW’s regular roster. I’ll be doing the exact same to prove why I deserve to be at the level I’ve been fortunate enough to get to so quickly so I’d advise folk to get a ticket before they disappear!\\n\\n8. Earliest wrestling memory?\\n\\nWaking up early on a Saturday to watch Smackdown on Sky 1 and asking my cousin to VHS record any PPV he would end up paying for. Think the first one I can remember watching back with him was Wrestlemania 17.\\n\\n9. You recently worked on the PBW Academy Attacks show in Coatbridge, where many PBW Academy students made their debuts. Are there any in particular that standout in your opinion?\\n\\nThe PBW Academy is amongst the top wrestling schools in Britain. It has 3 branches (Airdrie/Barrhead/Greenock) and has churned out some of the best young talent on the scene just now such as Noam Dar, Andy Wild, Kay Lee Ray, Davey Blaze, TJ Rage, Saqib Ali and more. To say I picked a great school to learn is an understatement. The talent coming through just now including myself have had a lot of opportunities to showcase there talents and the academy attack shows are definitely one of the chance to shine in front of a crowd and also in front of certain promoters. It has opened doors for a lot of younger guys who have stood out such as Lou King Sharp, Brendan Cooper, Tommy Marx, Aaron Echo and more. Lou King Sharp in particular has started to make a name for himself debuting on the first Academy Attack show against myself and in the last year he has went on to wrestle for Pro Wrestling Elite, British Championship Wrestling and is also confirmed for ICW Space Baws. He is so unique with his character work and I’m pleased he is getting the opportunities he is getting.\\n\\n10. You made your PCW debut recently, how was the PCW experience and has this led to further opportunities to wrestle outside Scotland?\\n\\nWorking for PCW was a cool experience. I was given a shot in there annual Rumble and managed to last about 15 minutes which wasn’t so bad for the skinniest guy in the match. I’d love to work there again but in less crowded match so I could really show the fans down there exactly what I can bring to the table. Other opportunities to wrestle outside Scotland have come up recently with my debut in May for Kamikaze Pro which is a great promotion down in Birmingham. I’m also set to debut in Ireland at the end of the year. Also luckily for me I’ve had the chance to wrestle outside of Scotland through ICW who have ran successful shows in both London and Newcastle.\\n\\nI’ve been really fortunate so far with the opportunities I’ve had in wrestling and I’m so grateful to both TJ Rage and Kid Fite for their high level of training and to all the promoters who have ever put my on a show. I’m having a rare time with the wrestling and I’m lucky to be a part of some of the top promotions in the country.\\n\\nCheers to Kenny for taking the time to answer the questions, and it goes without saying, but get yerselves to all of these shows, and any other show Kenny might be on, and any other show with wrestling on it, cause wrestling is the fuckin best shit on the planet that disnae involve breasts, and sometimes it even involves breasts!',\n",

       " 'Monday, April 5, 2010\\n\\nInspiration From Behind\\n\\nToday I was driving home from work and noticed a truck in front of me, one lane over. It was actually the truck\\'s camper I noticed, truth be told, which looked like Paul Bunyan\\'s playpen if he went to a daycare that wasn\\'t up to code. The wooden slats were covered in bumper stickers of varying colors and sizes. What I have to assume was a strategic move to ensure maximum readership, the best sticker of the bunch was placed in the top right-hand corner (which we all know from Google analysis is the most effective spot).\\n\\nIt said, \"Don\\'t be a dick.\"\\n\\nYeah, I thought. I\\'m with you, buddy. Now, this was a sentiment I support. It wasn\\'t political (there was no Dick Cheney photo), it wasn\\'t a band (like Citizen Dick) and it didn\\'t have a web site promoted underneath. I took it as a proverb of sorts, probably more colorful than Jesus would like, but with the same kind of heart.\\n\\nI started to look for an image of this particular bumper sticker online so I could post it here, but after three unsuccessful tries I started to get a gnawing feeling in my stomach. This is my work laptop I\\'m writing on, and I really don\\'t want to have to explain to someone why I kept typing \"dick\" into a search engine after hours. Who\\'s with me here?\\n\\nWhat stuck with me most is there\\'s got to be a story behind this. Most people post a sticker that announces their political persuasion, their vanity about their kids\\' grades, their desire to pee on a [insert your brand here] vehicle, or what their stick figure family would look like. I don\\'t often see a sticker with a good lesson for us all on the back of a truck camper. (Although I did find it polite that one was open about the fact that he does brake for hookers; it\\'s always good to know when a large vehicle is coming to a stop. Thanks for the heads up!) So I\\'m thinking either the guy driving had such a bad experience, SUCH a dick in his life that he felt personally responsible from preventing it from happening to someone else...or he is fully aware he is a horrible driver, plans to continue driving badly, and is warning you upfront not to succumb to road rage. The more I thought about it, the less warm fuzzy I felt and the more worried I became.Are you about to litter? I wondered. What, am I not supposed to get mad if you throw your trash out the window, only to have it bounce off my windshield? Or if you keep encountering dick after dick, shouldn\\'t you do a little self-examination? Maybe it\\'s YOU, not them.\\n\\nWith a sticker like that, a cop is bound to notice. So what, are you anti-police or something? Anti-government? Are you one of those crazies who lives on a compound somewhere? Don\\'t get in my lane.\\n\\nAnd really, by telling me not to \"be\" a dick, aren\\'t you kind of saying I could be already, that you see that quality in me, even though all I\\'m doing is driving behind you, innocently, listening to my Owl City album on my iPod? That\\'s pretty rude, man. Jeez. Why don\\'t you take your own advice already and leave me the hell alone?',\n",

       " 'When 24-year-old Morris Beckman returned to his house on Amhurst Road in Hackney, he’d experienced quite a lot. His time fighting fascism abroad had seen him survive two Nazi torpedo attacks on a British Navy ship in the Atlantic. While his relieved mother showered him with affection on his return home, his father’s message was rather starker: ‘The bastards are back,’ he warned. Indeed, the London that Beckman returned to fell far short of the expectations of himself and millions of other ex-servicemen. Though it may run counter to the popular narrative of the triumph over Hitler, fascism grew rapidly in Britain immediately following the Second World War. Fascist prisoners interned during the war began to reorganise their crippled movement, while a new presence of captured Nazi soldiers being released from prisoner-of-war camps and into British society prompted a far-right renaissance. Within months of the war’s end, fourteen fascist groups and at least three bookshops operated openly across the city. Newspapers with names like Britain Awake and The Patriot were readily available on street corners. Most alarmingly of all, fascists began staging outdoor rallies in the densely-Jewish East End once again. ‘Openly in the streets you had public meetings shouting out the same antagonism and the same filth as before the war,’ commando veteran Jules Konopinski recalled, ‘and now even worse – they were saying the gas chambers weren’t enough.’ Alarm spread among the Jewish community that anti-Semitism could find a foothold so soon after the defeat of the Nazis.\\n\\nEmergence Nowhere was alarm at the situation felt more strongly than in Maccabi House, a Jewish sports club in Hampstead. Morris Beckman recalled that the club had a ‘subdued ambience’ that reflected the ‘weariness and uncertainties’ of the times. Polish-Jewish veterans of the Allied forces with no families or homes to return to were forging friendships in a new city. Several pre-war Maccabi regulars died fighting Hitler. The ones that had survived, once awash with optimism, were now world-weary veterans who mixed uncomfortably with jovial teenagers who hadn’t served. In those days the true enormity of the Holocaust wasn’t known, and as the full picture began to emerge it had a profound effect on the community. Jewish ex-servicemen in particular carried a ‘sick sense of shame’, Beckman said, that no Allied action had been taken to prevent Nazi operations in the death camps. This consciousness was emerging at the same time as walls in London — whose Jewish community had only escaped the fate of their European neighbours by geographical quirk — were once again being daubed with swastikas. To many, it felt as if Britain hadn’t learnt a thing. The Truth, a magazine whose editor, Colin Brooks, was a close confidante of Daily Mail owner Lord Rothermere, called for Jews to give up their houses to ‘British’ ex-servicemen. In October 1945, thousands signed an ‘anti-alien’ petition in Hampstead which called to expel the area’s large Jewish refugee population. In February 1946, while driving for a pint in Hampstead Heath, four young Jewish ex-servicemen — the former Hurricane ace Alec Carson, Gerry Flamberg, Len Sherman, and Morris Beckman — witnessed a rally by the British League of Ex-Servicemen and Women, the organisation of Jeffrey Hamm. A familiar face of pre-war fascism, Hamm was interned for his loyalty to Hitler and was now seeking to rebuild Oswald Mosley’s movement. Addressing a sixty-strong meeting, Hamm chose his words carefully, denouncing the ‘aliens in our midst’ who ‘waxed fat in the black market’ while British soldiers died. Pretending to buy a copy of Britain Awake, Sherman abruptly knocked two fascists unconscious by banging their heads together. Flamberg toppled the makeshift stage and knocked Hamm over. As the crowd scattered, an elderly German Jew stayed to shake their hands. It occurred to all four that they could face serious charges for their actions. ‘Well then,’ Carson said, ‘it’s about time they change the laws.’ Their action was widely supported, and an organising meeting at Maccabi House was arranged to push back the fascist threat. Thirty-eight ex-servicemen and five women turned up. The vast majority were Jewish, but the group also included non-Jewish socialists like Joe Zilliacus, a former Marine and son of left-wing Labour MP Konni Zilliacus. What united them was their conviction that the Jewish community must not be passive in the face of provocations. Alec Black, a veteran of the D-Day landings, proposed establishing an organisation that could effectively fight fascism and anti-Semitism. He knew this would be a serious endeavour and emphasised that everyone involved would risk serious harm and jail time. Anyone feeling nervous about this activity could leave without any judgement or prejudice against them. No one moved an inch or said a word. The organisation had two aims: to prevent fascist activities by physical force if necessary, and to pressure Parliament into making racial incitement a criminal offence. Since those present had few motivations beyond completing the tasks at hand, no grandiose names were suggested. It was decided they would be called ‘The 43 Group’, after the number of people in the room. But, by April of that year, the name seemed misplaced; over 300 people had bolstered the Group’s ranks.\\n\\nConfrontation After encountering their first post-war instances of physical resistance, London’s fascists dropped their respectable veneer. Rather than hiding behind dog-whistle phrases, the seasoned repertoire of Hitler salutes, ‘Heil Mosley’ chants, and renditions of the Horst Wessel Lied, the Nazi anthem, returned. In the face of constant physical attacks in their communities and workplaces, fascist anger grew increasingly frenzied. A bomb was pushed through the door of Gerry Flamberg’s home, while two 43 Group commandos beat unconscious a young fascist who had stitched razorblades into a flat cap and charged through Stamford Hill slashing people’s faces. In November 1946, 43 Group militants published a letter in the Jewish Chronicle appealing for further assistance. It inspired a swell in members, but provoked an angry response from Louis Hydelman, who sat on the Board of Deputies of British Jews. Accusing the young commandos of acting ‘counterproductively’, Hydelman ordered the Group to disband. His intervention only highlighted the divide between young Jews committed to tackling the fascist presence and the older communal leadership, who remained legalistic in outlook. Hydelman’s letter, derided for its patronising tone, fell on deaf ears. The Group’s impressive infrastructure, convinced members they could afford to ignore their critics. Not only could they boast of an active base of 1,000 members, but they had also made influential friends. Left-wing Labour MPs such as D. N. Pritt, John Platt-Mills, and Woodrow Wyatt were keen supporters, while entertainment giants Jack Solomon and Bud Flanagan regularly donated significant sums to the organisation. On the streets, confrontations intensified. Tightly-organised 43 Group units would form human ‘wedges’ at rallies, pushing through fascist security to attack the stage, and use ‘supporting parties’ to heckle and break up fascist proceedings. On Sunday, 1 June 1947, these skirmishes came to a head in Ridley Road, a market area of Hackney known for its vibrant Jewish life. The fascists’ decision to demonstrate here was particularly provocative as it had been a favoured site of Mosley’s British Union of Fascists in the 1930s. The 43 Group organised for the ‘Battle for Ridley Road’ with military precision. Commandos were given maps of the surrounding streets with entry and exit points for ambush attacks. But walking up to the platform they were still taken back by the size of the far-right crowd. With police backing too, the fascists hugely outnumbered the 43 Group. But they nonetheless infiltrated the audience in front of the stage and, when fascist leader Alexander Raven Thomson began to speak, started heckling. ‘Going back to the Isle of Man for your holidays?’ one commando shouted. (Thomson had been imprisoned in a detention camp on the Isle of Man during the war.) ‘They should have hanged you with William Joyce!’ said another. Then the wedge struck and ferocious fighting broke out. A description of scenes by Morris Beckman recalls the intensity. A young fascist about eighteen years of age appeared in front of me and called me a ‘Fucking Jew bastard’, catching my left thigh with a nearly well-aimed kick. I hit his nose square on and it spurted blood … I kicked his backside as hard as I could and he staggered off. A hard blow landed smack on my right ear and completely unbalanced me. For a moment, I was dazed, disorientated. My assailant was about to close and finish me off when Sam grabbed him around the neck and pulled him to the ground. Then Sam jumped on him. The genial, good-humoured Sam said, ‘I’m just breaking the bastard’s ribs so he won’t attend any more meetings.’',\n",

The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of prophylactic intravenous antibiotics for the prevention of bacterial infections in cirrhotic patients with esophageal variceal bleeding. From December 1998 to September 2001, a total of 40 consecutive cirrhotic patients with Child-Pugh class B or C were enrolled after emergent endoscopic esophageal variceal ligation (EVL) was taken because of esophageal variceal bleeding. Enrolled patients were randomized into a treatment group and a control group. The treatment group (n=20) received the intravenous ciprofloxacin 200mg IV q 12 hours for 3 days while the control group(n=20) didn,t. Bacterial infection developed in nine patients (45%) of the control group and only two patients (10%) in the treatment group. The incidence of bacterial infections was significantly lower in the treatment group than the control group (p < 0.005). The hospital cost and length of hospital stay decreased in the treatment group compared with the control group (p < 0.001). There were no differences in the hospital course and mortality within 30 days between the two groups. In cirrhotic patients with variceal bleeding and with Child-Pugh class B or C, the use of intravenous ciprofloxacin for 3 days after EVL was not only effective in the prevention of bacterial infections but also cost-effective.',\n",

Republicans are safe at home, after decades of separating their flock from allegiance to the nation.\\n\\nMy objection to this essay is that Krauthammer clearly blames HRC for this mess, which in fact is concocted through tens of thousands of hours of cynical hard work by propagandists within the RNC and its free-lance enablers, like Krauthammer.\",\n",
       " \"One of greatest successes at the University of Oregon was the development of the zebrafish model organism. It is now considered one of the best systems for studying many aspects of development and disease, and Oregon gets a large amount of cachet for being the source of it. Interestingly, George Streisinger took many years to make the system work, and was considered by any outside metrics to be unproductive during that time. He would have been first on the chopping block if his employment was in the hands of a bean-counting Dean and he did not have tenure to protect him.\\n\\nNow, how to discern the unproductive from the temporarily unproductive future game-changers and protect only the latter? That I don't know. Maybe protecting game-changers is too much to ask of a university in dire financial straits and too much to ask of students in debt. But I think many people think of tenure as a way to protect just the political faculty; it affects the sciences as well.\",\n",

What on earth are you wearing? “No profanity: that’s fine, I’ve got a huge vocabulary.” It’s really clear that they’ve toned down Ricky Gervais from last year. Though the dig at Justin Bieber was pretty good. “No, he’s not the father. The only way he could impregnate anyone is if he borrowed one of Martha Stewart’s turkey basters.”\\n\\n7:07 Even Johnny Depp admits he hasn’t seen “The Tourist.” First sneak peek at the Best Motion Picture – Drama nominees is Hugo. This will be fun trying to figure out why certain people are presenting these films. Don’t see the Johnny Depp to Hugo connection yet.\\n\\n7:08 Gerard Butler and Mila Kunis present Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture. Christopher Plummer wins for “Beginners.” I can always count on the old people for adorable acceptance speeches.\\n\\n7:12 Ashton Kutcher and Elle MacPherson present Best Actress on TV in Comedy/Musical. Elle’s dress is weird-looking. She’s got weird wing things on her boobs. Amy Poehler thoroughly eyefucks the camera. Laura Dern wins for “Enlightened.” I can’t remember if it’s been canceled, but if it hasn’t, maybe someone will watch this show now…other than the Hollywood Foreign Press apparently. Had no idea Laura Dern’s mom is Diane Ladd. Nice. She gives shoutouts to Lucille Ball and Frank Capra. At least she has awesome inspirations. UPDATE: Enlightened was renewed. Maybe this will get people to watch it?\\n\\n7:19 Rob Lowe and Julianne Moore introduce Miss Golden Globe. Super awkward pause as the teleprompter freezes and someone brings Julianne Moore a script. Andie MacDowell’s daughter got recruited as this year’s Bring Your Daughter to an Awards Show person. Best Miniseries time. Golden Globe goes to Downton Abbey. Get ready for a sweep for Downton Abbey in the Miniseries categories tonight. People freaking love it. Adorable British people give adorable acceptance speech. We got distracted when our icemaker started working again.\\n\\n7:23 Rob Low and Julianne Moore come back to present Best Actress in a Miniseries. Kate Winslet wins for Mildred Pierce! This surprises absolutely no one. She didn’t have very steep competition. Sorry, Diane Lane. Kate Winslet is always so dignified and gracious. I’m pretty much in love with her. No lie. Finally starting with the play-off music.\\n\\n7:26 Frieda Pinto comes out to show a preview of Midnight in Paris. I’m thinking it’s the Oscars that tries to come up with connections to the movie. Golden Globes just gets random people to present the films.\\n\\n7:27 Okay, I want to watch what happens at the awards during the commercial break, especially as the attendees get progressively drunker. That would be a super entertaining show. Can we make this happen?\\n\\n7:32 Obligatory message from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association as we pretend to actually care about who brings these awards to us every year. Granted, they do a lot of philanthropic work, but no one will remember that after this speech. Sorry, y’all.\\n\\n7:33 Jake Gyllenhaal comes out to present a preview for My Week With Marilyn. Rant time: Why on earth is this in the Comedy or Musical category? It’s extremely dramatic and there is almost no music in it! Sometimes, I understand their reasoning, but this makes ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE!\\n\\n7:34 Ricky Gervais asks for short speeches. “You don’t have to thank members of your family who have done absolutely nothing.” Obligatory atheist dig at God. Melissa McCarthy and Paula Patton come out to present Best Actor in a TV Series – Drama. Paula is wearing a very yellow dress. I can’t decide how I feel about it. Kelsey Grammer wins for Boss. The HFPA loves to pretend like it’s super trendy and Boss is very trendy, but no one watches it.\\n\\n7:37 McCarthy and Patton stick around to present Best TV Series – Drama. Homeland wins. If Game of Thrones had ended after Homeland, it would have been GoT. The HFPA has such a short-term memory, though, and all anyone can talk about is how good Homeland is. Game of Thrones lost out by ending during the summer. The others didn’t have a shot. Massive cast gets on stage. Pretty sure it’ll take longer for all of them to get up there than they’ll be able to talk. Amy Poehler found something about Les Moonves super funny. Don’t know why this guy thanked Moonves. Does CBS own Showtime?\\n\\n7:44 Jimmy Fallon and Adam Levine come out and pull their best “moves like Jagger.” Fallon goes on to spaz and act weird. I love Jimmy Fallon, but that was just awkward. They present Best Original Score to Ludovic Bource for The Artist. Be prepared for The Artist to sweep tonight as well. Bource apologizes for being French. He talks about how music is universal. This guy is adorbs.\\n\\n7:48 Fallon and Levine stick around to present Best Original Song. Thought it would be Glenn Close, but they decided to pick Madonna instead. Oh well, this will be the only win for WE. I still don’t know why Madonna tries to have a really pretentious British accent sometimes. You’re not fooling anyone. Story about how Madonna had to be coerced into writing a song for her movie. None of us buy that. Also, that dress must be cutting off circulation to your boobs.\\n\\n7:52 Unknown Turkish film person comes out to say hey to her peeps in Turkey. Then she leaves. Well, that was weird.\\n\\n7:57 Debra Messing and Katharine McPhee come out to pimp their show and talk about how Best Actor in a Miniseries is one of the most prestigious awards ever. Weird. Idris Elba wins for Luther. Adorbs British accent. Super sexy. And he gives a shoutout to his daughter who is having a Golden Globe party. Adorable.\\n\\n7:59 Brad Pitt comes out to present Ides of March. Want to see this so badly. Ryan Gosling is beautiful. As per us.\\n\\n8:00 Seth Rogen and Kate Beckinsale come out to present Best Actress in a Movie – Comedy or Musical. Jodie Foster brought her kids. How cute. Michelle Williams wins for the “hysterical comedy” My Week With Marilyn. Thank you, Seth Rogen, for pointing this out to us. Michelle Williams thanks her daughter. She points out that Marilyn Monroe won the same award she just did. She seems so flustered and adorbs. She’s come so far since the days of Dawson’s Creek.\\n\\n8:08 Sarah Michelle Gellar and Piper Perabo come out to present Best Supporting Actor on TV. Perabo’s dress is hiding some people in it. No joke. That thing is huge. Jesse Tyler Ferguson holds up a sign that says “whatever” over Eric Stonestreet’s shoulder. Peter Dinklage wins, which shocks no one. He talks about how his mom thought Guy Pearce would win in this category instead. He could hide in Piper Perabo’s skirt easily.\\n\\n8:10 Ricky Gervais talks about how last year’s audience had “a right stick up their ass.” He introduces George Clooney and says if he gets any more popular or handsome, he’ll be hosting the show next year. Clooney stole Brad Pitt’s cane and comes out to present Moneyball.\\n\\n8:13 Channing Tatum and Jessica Alba come out to present Best Animated Feature Film. The Adventures of Tintin wins, upsetting the streak that Rango has been having in this category. We decide Steven Spielberg probably has a shed devoted to the Golden Globes.\\n\\n8:20 Ewan McGregor comes out to present a preview for 50/50. He gives a shoutout to Christopher Plummer and says “good job, Pops.”\\n\\n8:23 Felicity Huffman and William H. Macy come out to present Best Supporting Actress on TV, all in song. Adorbs. Jessica Lange wins for American Horror Story. She was definitely the best actor on that show. Sorry, Jessica Lange, but your dress is super fug. Jessica Lange thanks the people who worked on her show. Producers do a close-up on Meryl Streep, for some inexplicable reason. Lange goes on to call many writers in Hollywood talentless hacks, but she does it in a super classy way.\\n\\n8:28 So, there’s this one commercial for McDonald’s that can’t decide which dimension it wants to be in and it just switches rapidly between dimensions. I feel it needs a warning for people who are epileptic.\\n\\n8:30 Ricky Gervais has moved on to wine. He introduces Madonna by saying she’s “just like a virgin.” Madonna then says Ricky should come over and do something about that. Ricky then runs across the back of the stage. Funniest moment of the night so far. Madonna says she grew up watching foreign films and there’s nothing foreign about them to her. I call bullshit on her pretentiousness. Angelina Jolie loses to Iran for “A Separation.” Also, Christian Bale is in the film from China. Iranian guy gives a very touching acceptance speech while another guy stands next to him with his arms crossed and looks super pissed off.\\n\\n8:34 Aw, Dustin Hoffman! He gives a thank you speech before going on to announce nominations for Best Actress on TV – Drama. Claire Danes wins for Homeland, which shocks absolutely no one. She comes out from the back way for some weird reason. She winks and points at her table. She thanks her parents because she forgot to thank them when she won back in 1995 for My So-Called Life. Her mom is apparently her date. Adorbs. She thanks her gorgeous husband, Hugh Dancy. And here comes the playoff music.\\n\\n8:38 Accountants come out to strike a pose with the envelope for Best Actor in a Comedy/Musical – TV. Close-up on the female accountant’s boobs. The envelope is front of them, but it’s still awkward.\\n\\n8:42 Emily Blunt comes out to present the preview for Bridesmaids, the funniest movie of the past year. Apparently, all anyone can talk about is that “women can finally poop their pants.”\\n\\n8:43 Tina Fey and Jane Lynch come out to present Best Actor on TV in a Comedy/Musical. They have the best banter ever. Matt LeBlanc wins for Episodes. Apparently, the HFPA decides that since Alec Baldwin refuses to show up anymore, they’ll give it to someone else. If only it could have been Johnny Galecki. Alas. Matt LeBlanc is pretty freaking awesome, though.\\n\\n8:46 Bradley Cooper comes out to present Best Supporting Actress in a Movie. Octavia Spencer wins for The Help. So well-deserved. I may have hated that movie, but she was truly fantastic. Maya Rudolph gives her a standing ovation. Everyone wants to kiss her on the way up. They play the super inspirational song from The Help. Everyone in that room loves her. Seriously. Melissa McCarthy is in tears. Octavia is crying as she quotes MLK. I love when people are legitimately blown away by their wins. She is so flustered and is just absolutely endearing. Fun fact: The Help is at Table 10 tonight.\\n\\n8:52 Apparently, the Golden Globes are tweeting the winners before they’re announced on TV. Nice one, y’all.\\n\\n8:55 Sidney Poitier comes out to present the Cecil B. DeMille Award to Morgan Freeman. Everyone gives him a standing ovation. He begins talking about how kickass Morgan Freeman is and how he becomes every character he plays. Shoutouts to Spencer Tracy, Laurence Olivier, and others. Morgan Freeman looks like he’s about to cry. Poitier says Freeman is a prince in the profession he has chosen. Helen Mirren comes out and says she’s had a couple glasses of wine, but she has a bone to pick with Morgan Freeman because she’s only been in one film with him. It goes on a bit long, but it’s Helen Mirren so we’re okay with it. And here comes the retrospective of films. Damn, this man has been in some amazing movies over time.\\n\\n9:00 Best part of that retrospective: the clip from Electric Company where he’s bathing in a casket. And according to IMDB, his first role was as an uncredited man on the street in The Pawnbroker in 1964.\\n\\n9:03 Morgan Freeman comes up and says he absolutely loves Helen Mirren. He said that after working with her on Red and watching her handle a gun, he knows he never wants to piss her off. He also says he will call his award the Sidney Poitier Award. He talks about how he got to make movies with people he admires and that he’s had so much fun. Then he randomly says hey to Elton John. Oh, Morgan Freeman. You’re so fantastic.\\n\\n9:07 Fun fact: Morgan Freeman’s first credited role was in a 1971 film called “Who Says You Can’t Ride a Rainbow.” He played a character named Afro.\\n\\n9:10 Robert Downey, Jr. comes out in a tux with tails. He introduces the preview of The Artist.\\n\\n9:12 Angelina Jolie comes out to introduce Best Director. Martin Scorsese wins for Hugo. Definitely thought it was going to be Michel Hazanavicius. Scorsese gives a shoutout to the HFPA for their work in film preservation. He gives a shoutout to his wife who gave him the book Hugo is based on and encouraged him to make a film his 12-year-old daughter could actually see. Ben Kingsley waves from the back. Scorsese leaves out Chloe Grace Moretz, which makes me sad.\\n\\n9:15 Ricky Gervais is back with another glass of wine. He introduces Salma Hayek and Antonio Banderas. They bleep Ricky Gervais and then Antonio Banderas starts yelling in Spanish. If he’s saying something bad, the censors don’t know it. They go on to give Best TV Comedy to Modern Family. The kids all run up from the back. Sofia Vergara starts yelling in Spanish. She’s either really silly or she is absolutely smashed right now. Best acceptance speech ever. Sofia Vergara gives the actual acceptance speech in Spanish and Steven Levitan (I think) translates it, but turns it into a speech about how the writers are the best lovers Sofia has had and all film actresses need to give them their numbers. Freaking awesome.\\n\\n9:23 Michelle Pfeiffer comes out. Her face does not look real anymore. She goes on to show the preview for War Horse.\\n\\n9:24 What is Jessica Biel wearing and why does she have three boobs all of a sudden? Her and Mark Wahlberg present Best Actor in a Movie – Comedy/Musical to Jean Dujardin for The Artist. Dujardin mentions that he is French, too. Nice callback to Ludovic Bource’s speech earlier. Dujardin tells how he was told that he would never do movies because his face is too expressive. Apparently, his eyebrows think independently. That man is freaking adorable.\\n\\n9:31 Queen Latifah (from “Joyful Noise,” which she has to pretend is a good movie right now) comes out to introduce The Help.\\n\\n9:33 Ricky Gervais has ditched his ugly jacket. He introduces Colin Firth and acts super jealous of him. According to Gervais, Colin Firth is super racist and has punched a blind kitten. Firth makes a dig back at Gervais and goes on to introduce the nominees for Best Actress – Drama. Meryl Streep wins for The Iron Lady. Everyone gives her a standing ovation. She acts like she’s surprised to win and says she only got to play Margaret Thatcher after Ricky Gervais’s deal fell through. They bleep Meryl Streep. Pretty sure that’s not allowed. Someone is passing her glasses up from the back. And Meryl is just naming off random actresses now. Meryl just called Harvey Weinstein God. She’ll probably get some crap for that tomorrow. They start to play her off, but she says no and they stop for a second. That’s how famous Meryl Streep is, y’all.\\n\\n9:39 Jane Fonda comes out to present Best Movie – Comedy/Musical. In a move that surprises absolutely no one, The Artist wins. Even the dog is there! People get distracted from the producer’s speech by the dog’s adorableness. Also, Jean Dujardin’s wife is totally recording the entire ceremony on her cameraphone. So adorbs. The dog is totally begging for a treat. So cute. Another producer tries to say something, but they are actually pulling the mic back into the stage. Damn.\\n\\n9:47 Ricky Gervais introduces Natalie Portman and talks about putting her family first this year led her to not be nominated for anything. She presents Best Actor in a Drama to George Clooney for The Descendants. Where the fuck is Ryan Gosling? Why isn’t he there? I want to see his beautiful, feminist-loving face and body in a tux tonight. George Clooney is his standard, adorable self.\\n\\n9:54 Harrison Ford comes out to present Best Picture – Drama. They barely even show his face before they start showing the nominees. The Descendants wins. One of the producers comes up and says they’ve been told to hurry, so they rush through the acceptance speech as much as possible. Alexander Payne starts talking. Play-off music starts up.\\n\\n9:57 Ricky Gervais comes back to close out the show. Perfect summary of the evening, “I hope you’ve enjoyed your goodie bags, the champagne, the gold. I hope it took your mind off the recession.” They end with a close-up of the crystal chandelier. Nice.\\n\\n9:59 Final score. 15 for 25. Was hoping for closer to 70 or 75%, but at least I finished above 50%. Hope y’all haven’t been too bored by my ramblings. See ya for the Oscars.',\n",

The effective date of service from the new Marketer and termination of the former Marketer will occur on the first day of the calendar month following the completion of the following new Marketer participation requirements:\\n\\nAn AES must notify DTE Electric at least 30 days prior to the effective date of service from the new Marketer and termination of the former Marketer by submitting a new Alternative Electric Supplier-Marketer Notice form located in “AES Declaring a Switch of Marketer Relationship” section of the Supplier Tool Box.\\n\\nThe new entity you selected as your company’s Marketer must register for the Marketer participant role. Please direct your Marketer to complete the steps in the “How to Qualify as a Marketer” section of the Supplier Tool Box.\\n\\nThe DTE Electric Supplier Account Manager assigned to your company will contact the established AES Daily Contact Representative to assist your company with the Switch of Marketer Relationship Process.\\n\\nWhat is the process for a Complete Billing AES to update their financial institution with DTE Electric?\\nWhen an AES who elected to participate in DTE Electric Choice Program with the Complete Billing Option changes financial institution the AES must provide DTE Electric the new banking information via the following process:\\n\\nThe DTE Electric Supplier Account Manager assigned to your company will contact the established AES Daily Contact Representative to assist your company with the process to declare the new financial institution.\\n\\nParticipant Relationships\\n\\nIf I am both the alternative electric supplier (AES) and the Marketer, do I need to execute the AES-Marketer Notice (identifying a relationship with myself)?\\nYes. Even though you are both the AES and marketer, you must sign the AES-Marketer Notice. The AES-Marketer Notice informs DTE Electric whom the AES will have as its Marketer.\\n\\nCan an AES have more than one Marketer?\\nYes. AESs will need to identify each marketer with whom they will conduct business in a separate AES-Marketer Notice submitted to DTE Electric. A separate CP Node designation is required for each AES-Marketer business relationship.\\n\\nObtaining Usage Information\\n\\nWho will be allowed to get customer information and the associated historical usage data?\\nThe customer has always had access to its historical usage information and will continue to have access under the Electric Choice Program. Anyone authorized by the customer can get customer historical usage information. A Customer Information Release form is used to facilitate this request. The Customer Information Release form can be found in the Supplier Tool Box section of this website.\\n\\nHow long does it take to get a customer\\'s 12-month bill history once we have faxed the request?\\nCustomer use information will be sent to the requestor within ten (10) business days of receipt of the request, barring unusual circumstances.\\n\\nHow will the AES get billing determinants to use in billing its customers for energy?\\nThe AES will get an XML 867 transaction set after the enrolled account is invoiced by DTE Electric.\\n\\nHow will the AES know if the XML enrollments are received?\\nThe AES will receive an XML 814 confirmation transaction indicating a successful enrollment. For rejected enrollments, the XML 814 provides the reasons for rejection.\\n\\nHow will the AES and Marketer know when the customer is ready for electric choice service?\\nBoth the AES and Marketer will receive an XML 814 transaction set indicating that the customer is Site Ready, which means all validation checks have been completed and all metering requirements are in place.\\n\\nHow does an AES or an Aggregator request Peak Load Contribution (PLC) values?\\nAn AES or an Aggregator should submit a completed Customer Information Release Form to the DTE Electric Choice Supplier Support Center to request PLC values.\\n\\nWho does an AES or an Aggregator contact regarding Peak Load Contribution (PLC) calculations?\\nAn AES should contact the Supplier Account Manager that DTE Electric has assigned to your company when they have inquires about PLC calculations.\\nAn Aggregator should contact the DTE Electric Choice Supplier Support Center at 1.888.830.2170 from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm EST Monday through Friday or email them at suppliers@dteenergy.com\\n\\nBilling In-Service Electric Choice Accounts\\n\\nHow will customer billing be handled?\\nThe Alternative Electric Supplier (AES) has the option to have DTE Electric bill on its behalf, which is referred to as Complete Billing, or to bill its customers directly, which is referred to as Separate Billing. If the AES elects the Complete Billing option, the customer will receive one bill statement. The AES energy supply charges are separated from DTE Electric delivery charges to allow the customer to review each individual charge separately. If the AES chooses the Separate Billing option, the customer will receive two separate bills: one bill from the AES for energy supply charges and one bill from DTE Electric for delivery charges.\\n\\nWill there be a charge to switch to an Alternative Electric Supplier?\\nA $5.00 fee will be charged each time a customer switches to a different energy supplier. The switch fee applies when a customer switches from DTE Electric to an Alternative Electric Supplier (AES), from one AES to another AES, or from an AES back to DTE Electric.\\n\\nMeter Data\\n\\nFor those customers who elect to use the DTE Electric load profiling methodology, is there a cost associated with this service?\\nNo, there is no cost for the load profiling service.\\n\\nIf a separate data recording module is required for Marketers to obtain real-time data from a customer\\'s existing meter, is it DTE Electric\\'s intention to hold the Marketer responsible for the installation and maintenance of this equipment?\\nYes. The customer, AES or Marketer can install their own recorder using the pulses supplied at the meter installation. If they choose to have DTE Electric install the recorder, DTE Electric will charge the Marketer or customer for the installation and maintenance of DTE Electric approved separate data recording modules.\\n\\nWhat is your estimate of the cost of a data-recording module?\\nThe meter data-recording module is available for the customer at a cost of $8 per month. This request can be made by completing the Customer Information Release Form. For more information, please contact the DTE Electric Choice Supplier Support Center at 1.888.830.2170 Monday through Friday from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm EST.\\n\\nWho can I contact to ask questions about Load Profiling?\\nAES and Marketers should contact the Supplier Account Manager that DTE Electric has assigned to your company when they have inquiries regarding Load Profiling.\\n\\nEnrollment Process\\n\\nWhat is the Electric Choice “minimum term” for Business Customers?\\nThe minimum term for business customers is two years.\\n\\nWhat is the Electric Choice “minimum term”?\\nThe minimum term for Electric Choice Residential Electric Service is one full billing cycle.\\n\\nWhat is “slamming”?\\nSlamming is the unauthorized switching of a customer’s energy supply without their permission.\\n\\nHow will slamming be controlled?\\nThe DTE Electric Choice Program’s customer enrollment process incorporates a confirmation process to help reduce the likelihood of slamming. The electric restructuring legislation enacted in June 2000 made slamming illegal. The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) has established penalties for companies that engage in this practice. For more information, visit the MPSC website and search for MPSC Case Number U-12640.\\n\\nWhen the customer is enrolled and has been notified, can the customer dispute the enrollment?\\nIf the customer disputes their enrollment at any time, we will take the word of the customer, stop the enrollment process and notify the respective AES that the customer requested a cancellation.\\n\\nIf a customer is already enrolled with an AES and a second AES tries to enroll the same customer, what happens?\\nIf the customer\\'s first enrollment is still pending, the new enrollment will be rejected. However, if the customer is in service as an Electric Choice customer, the new enrollment will be treated as a switch request and all parties will be notified.\\n\\nWhere can I find DTE Electric’s current Electric Choice participation level numbers and available energy allotments for the DTE Electric Choice Program?\\nThe Cap Tracking System is a web-based tracker that displays the Cap level of the DTE Electric Choice Program. Click on Cap Tracking System on the menu bar to view the current Electric Choice participation level and available energy allotments of the DTE Electric Choice Program. Also DTE Electric reports its monthly and year-to-date retail sales summaries in the Appendix to the Power Supply Cost Recovery (PSCR) 45-Day Report.\\n\\nIf the regulated electric utility’s 10 percent cap is fully subscribed, what happens to new enrollments that I submit?\\nUnder state law, no more than 10 percent of a regulated electric utility’s average weather-adjusted retail sales for the preceding calendar year may take service from an Alternative Electric Supplier at any time. If the regulated electric utility’s 10 percent cap is fully subscribed, new enrollments will be placed in a Cap queue, per the procedures established in Case No. U-15801. For more information regarding Case No. U-15801 and the Electric Choice 10% Cap, please see the Customer Choice tab under Electricity on the MPSC website.\\n\\nWhat happens if an enrolled account either moves or asks for a read out or read in?\\nIf a customer notifies us of a move and requests a disconnect, we will initiate the \"Drop\" functionality in the system, which in turn notifies the AES and marketer of record of this \"Drop.\" The meter read data will be obtained and forwarded as part of an 867 XML transaction set.\\n\\nHow is the name or other customer information shared between the AES and DTE Electric as the distribution company?\\nDTE Electric releases customer information used to establish an AES relationship when we receive the properly executed Customer Information Release form submitted on behalf of the customer and signed by both the customer and the AES. Information beyond usage information, such as payment history and credit, is not released unless the customer chooses to give this information to the AES.',\n",

       " 'Experts quickly connected the alleged shooter, a truck driver named Robert Bowers, with Gab’s anti-Semitism by reviewing his posts, which were publicly available but have since been removed from the site, which itself was shuttered for several days after the attack but is once again available. When the Southern Poverty Law Center analyzed Bowers’s posts, it identified central themes that included “white genocide” and “globalism” — a buzzword often referring to anti-Jewish conspiracy theories. Similar analyses of his posts presented equivalent conclusions.\\n\\nWe have a unique set of data that includes not just all of Bowers’s Gab posts but also all Gab posts since the site launched in 2016. The daily use of Gab is climbing. When the Pittsburgh shooting occurred, we recognized that our data could tell us more about both the accused shooter and his network — and possibly offer clues about who might escalate from online hate to violence.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat did the alleged Pittsburgh shooter talk about on Gab, and with whom?\\n\\nWe used a custom API to scrape every post, reply and quote from every user on Gab, reaching back to the site’s launch in 2016. Our database includes all Gab posts, even those users subsequently deleted from the site. We used text-analysis methods in Python to analyze the massive volume of data.\\n\\nSince joining Gab in January 2018, Bowers contributed 998 posts and replies to others’ posts. With text analytics of his nearly 1,000 posts, replies and quotes, we found overwhelmingly anti-Semitic ideations.\\n\\nBower’s two most commonly used words were “kike” and “jew,” often associated with terms like “vile” and “degenerate,” and many other anti-Semitic references as well. For example, he frequently used the hashtag “#everysingletime,” referring to an alt-right Jewish conspiracy theory in which Jews are behind orchestrated efforts to attack white culture and values.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGab has “groups” in which members with similar interests hold conversations. Many of Bowers’s posts were in these groups, especially the “Guns of Gab,” “Supremacy,” “Immigration” and “Anti-white” groups, which reinforced his interest in firearms and white-supremacist philosophy.\\n\\nBowers boasted about 600 friends and followers on Gab but was far less active than many in his network. Judging by the number of messages sent among members, Bowers was tightly connected with a select few members of this network and loosely connected with many.\\n\\nComparing Bowers to the typical Gab user\\n\\nWe compared Bowers’s activity and his social network to the larger Gab community. Our analysis suggests that while Bowers does not perfectly represent the rest of Gab’s members, substantial similarities exist.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe gathered the 200 most commonly used hashtags on Gab to compare to Bowers’s. The hashtags included #altright and #whitegenocide, themes in Bowers’s posts. Bowers’s posts and the most popular Gab hashtags both included references to political conspiracy theories such as #qanon and #releasethememo.\\n\\nBut Bowers’s posts and replies differ in his nearly exclusive focus on anti-Semitic ideas. In the rare times he touched on other topics, those were general alt-right political discussions about white supremacy and related themes. The average Gab user was much more focused on general current political topics, with hashtags including #maga, #trump, #fakenews and #politics.\\n\\nThe larger network active on Gab\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGab conversations are heavily laden with alt-right themes. As you can see in the illustration above, since 2016, one of the hashtags most commonly used on Gab has been #altright.\\n\\nOther common Gab hashtags from the same data set suggest broader anti-immigration themes, including #buildthewall, #bansharia and #banislam. These hashtags were among the most common in a set of more than 30 million posts — indicating that these sentiments are pervasive. As you can see, Gab also overflows with political conspiracy theory discussions, with such common hashtags as #pizzagate, #draintheswamp and #deepstate. Gun rights activism shows up in hashtags such as #2a and #nra.\\n\\nUsers have posted roughly 30 million comments on Gab since its 2016 launch. Below you can see that the volume of Gab activity by posts, replies and quotes has grown over time.\\n\\nWhite supremacy and anti-Semitism have endured in the United States. The Anti-Defamation League documented a 57 percent increase in anti-Semitic incidents from 2016 to 2017. FBI hate crime statistics for 2016 show that more than half of faith-based crimes were against Jews.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAfter the August 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, many expected the alt-right to retreat from physical gatherings and return to digital realms. Instead, alt-right gangs such as the Proud Boys, the Atomwaffen Division and their followers, have become bolder, engaging in street violence at rallies, bomb plots and killings.\\n\\nOur analyses show that Bowers is not alone in his hatred. Gab has roughly 450,000 users, and while many do not espouse anti-Semitism, a sizable number do and regularly connect online to share their ideology. Our analyses also show that these individuals are not difficult to find or monitor.\\n\\nThe challenge comes in knowing when they will escalate from online speech to real-world action.\\n\\nMatthew Phillips (@mdphill1_uncc) is an assistant professor of criminal justice and criminology at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nArunkumar Bagavathi is a final-year PhD student in the computer science department at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

Having integrated tools for monitoring and troubleshooting performance of your voice and application traffic simultaneously is essential.\\nThe nGenius Solution leverages rich, actionable information to provide the visibility and control necessary for monitoring, troubleshooting, and planning for VoIP technologies both in the corporate LAN or across your MPLS WAN.\\n\\nThe VoIP management challenge\\nThe slowly maturing VoIP platform has enterprises taking a long look at this technology, and not just for cost savings. Many of these potential users are opting for in-house rather than service-provider solutions because of the additional savings, future flexibility, and a simple lack of consistent vision by the large telco providers.\\nThose adventurous souls who implement VoIP themselves face the daunting task of managing a voice-oriented data network. For network managers accustomed to data networks, this job requires a specialized toolkit.\\nTo determine the best option for the enterprise market, we gathered four VoIP testing contenders and turned them loose on the VoIP installations at our Advanced Network Computing Laboratory (ANCL) testing facility at the University of Hawaii.\\n\\nVoIP\\nManagementIt\\'s clear that VoIP technology is the future of telephony, making effective VoIP management the task of every telecom manager. As the convergence of voice and data networks raises new challenges, telecom managers are seeking new solutions. For example, VoIP technology has introduced a whole new set of security concerns. It is no longer just IT network administrators who have to worry about viruses and denial of service attacks. And because VoIP technology is usually added on to a legacy TDM system, voice networks are becoming much more complex to manage. That\\'s why telecom managers around the world are turning to SecureLogix for superior VoIP management solutions.\\n\\nBusiness communication and VoIP Management\\nNetwork management vendor NetIQ claims it has a way to answer the question a bit more definitively. Last month, the company announced two products, one that aims to give enterprises information before they deploy voice over IP (VOIP), the other to help manage VOIP systems as they go into pilot and, ultimately, full deployment.\\nThe first product is called VOIP Assessor. It\\'s a software package designed to let enterprises generate traffic loads that will imitate a full VOIP system\\'s traffic across the network. Such measurements provide information that can\\'t be gleaned from a pilot that simply uses an IP PBX and a few dozen IP phones, according to Steve Joyce, director of network technologies at NetIQ.\\n\\nThe Improve VoIP\\nManagementA successful voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) deployment requires careful consideration of and adequate planning for the system\\'s long-term management requirements. Your deployment and integration plans must identify the methods and technologies through which you will monitor, support, and maintain reliability across the VoIP network. Voice traffic is considerably more sensitive to network conditions than normal data traffic and your management plans account for this fact.\\nAlong with VoIP management\\'s technical requirements, your plan should also address potential personnel issues and functional task changes. Dedicated telecommunications personnel normally administer voice systems and conduct voice-specific tasks. As you integrate VoIP with the IP network, these responsibilities may be shifted to or shared with native data-networking staff.\\n\\nThe wake-up call for VoIP Management\\nService providers are beginning to recognize the importance of VoIP management as an important element of their long-term VoIP investment.\\nFor some carriers there is a true ?disconnect? between the two areas due to poor planning.\\nIn fact, recent discussions with enterprise telecom managers indicate that VoIP Quality of Service (QoS) and security are critical concerns that must be solved before large scale VoIP service adoption occurs. During the next three years, enterprises will assess their VoIP requirements including business need and impact, costs and technical staffing. Many will turn to outsourcing because of the high level of complexity. To seize this\\nopportunity, carriers must better understand the importance of managing VoIP.\\n\\nVOIP Management for BusinessesDespite promises of streamlined efficiency and ease of convergence, network managers are discovering that running voice calls over the data network is rarely simple.\\nTo help the growing number of businesses turning to IP telephony, vendors are adding functions to make VOIP (voice over IP) management easier, and they\\'re adding services for enterprises that can\\'t make VOIP work on their own.\\nAvaya Inc., which has been selling IP telephony systems for three years, this week at the VoiceCon conference in Orlando, Fla., will unveil its Enterprise Service Platform to give customers the option of letting the vendor remotely monitor the network on a subscription basis. Avaya\\'s Secure Intelligent Gateway connects the vendor\\'s network operations center to the customer\\'s site, providing a simultaneous view of voice and data streams.\\n\\nVoIP Solution and Target management Holes A study released last week shows that the growing adoption of VoIP service among enterprises is exposing \"critical weaknesses\" in the tools used to manage those networks. The report, called \"The VoIP Management Gap: Problems and Solutions,\" was published last week by Light Reading\\'s Enterprise VoIP Insider. It looks at the challenges of VoIP, including service-quality issues and the impact of sub-par management tools. The lack of such tools is motivating experienced data management vendors, such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Cisco, to move into the space via acquisition. These companies will be welcomed with open arms by customers that want to deploy VoIP networks with minimal performance hiccups, such as jitter, latency and packet loss.\\n\\nVoIP\\nPerformance ManagementThe banking industry is all about mitigating risk, and UMB Bank did just that with its recent VoIP implementation by adding a performance management system to the mix. The Kansas City, Mo.-based firm, with 150 banking centers throughout six states and approximately 3,500 employees, decided that a next-generation VoIP system would best suit its communications needs.\\nBill Taylor, assistant vice president and manager of network services at UMB Bank, said because its previous network infrastructure was aging and in need of replacement, the IT staff developed a strategy to provide its various locations with more reliable network service to support VoIP.\\nWe looked at legacy key and PBX systems, but quickly discovered there was no next generation for those products because everything was being developed around VoIP technology,\" he said. \"But we realized that to roll out a new voice system at these locations, we\\'d have to change our network\\narchitecture.',\n",

       " 'Have you heard that the Republican tax reform proposal is a sweetheart deal for \"the rich,\" and doesn\\'t help middle class Americans? Yes, you have. Liberals keep repeating it, and we keep debunking it -- over and over again. These claims largely stem from some combination of (a) ignorance of the facts, (b) a misleading focus on raw dollars versus percentages (of course wealthy taxpayers will receive more relief in terms of sheer dollars, as they shoulder -- by far -- the highest proportional and actual tax burden of any income cohort, and (c) cherry-picked data points from a distant, hypothetical and unlikely future in which Congress chooses to allow a giant tax hike on the middle class. In reality, the overwhelming majority of all middle class households will receive a tax cut under the GOP plan, and the rich don\\'t receive a disproportional benefit. Indeed, at the request of President Trump, House Republicans wrote their bill to exclude an income rate cut for the \"millionaires and billionaires\" Democrats so love to invoke. But that didn\\'t stop the Washington Post from once again claiming in a front page story that the Republican-crafted legislation had veered away from middle income earners in favor of the rich. The CATO Institute\\'s Chris Edwards swooped in with a detailed fact check, starting with a description of WaPo\\'s false premise:\\n\\nNews stories are portraying the Republican tax bills as favoring the rich, even though the opposite is true. The GOP cuts would make the tax code more progressive, and the largest percentage cuts would go to middle-income households. The Washington Post pushed another faulty narrative yesterday. The three layers of headlines on the hardcopy front page were, “Trump’s tax vow taking a U-turn—focus shifted away from middle class—GOP plan evolved into a windfall for the wealthy.” The story’s theme was that Trump originally promised middle-class tax cuts, but House and Senate tax bills have morphed into an orgy of tax cuts for corporations and rich people. Ridiculous.\\n\\nWhy \"ridiculous\"? Well, because the facts say so:\\n\\nRather than a “windfall for the wealthy” as the Post claims, the GOP bills would provide larger percentage cuts for middle earners than higher earners (see here and here). The GOP may abandon cutting the top individual tax rate at all. Much of the cuts for high earners are allocated corporate tax cuts, but economists disagree about who those cuts would actually benefit. Furthermore, the GOP tax bills would increase spending subsidies (refundable credits) for people at the bottom who do not pay any individual income taxes. Look at this TPC analysis of the Senate bill. It shows the bottom two quintiles receiving tax “cuts” in 2019 and 2025, yet those groups do not currently pay any income taxes on net...The following chart shows the TPC data in context. First, note the enormous share of federal taxes paid by the top quintile under current law. The chart includes all federal taxes—income, payroll, estate, and excise for 2019. Now observe that the top quintile would receive a smaller share of the Senate tax cut than their tax share under current law. For the three middle quintiles, it is the opposite. That means that the Senate tax cut would make the federal tax code more progressive. If the Senate tax cut is enacted, higher earners would pay a larger share of the overall federal tax burden.\\n\\nEdwards\\' analysis laments the fact that the GOP plan is too progressive and therefore insufficiently pro-growth, but despite those frustrations, he cannot abide supposedly objective journalists furnishing readers with the opposite of the truth. Here is the chart he mentions:\\n\\n\\n\\nNotice that the top 20 percent pay close to 70 percent of all federal taxes (blue bars), but would receive just over 60 percent of the tax cut (red bars) under the Senate bill. For the bottom quintile -- who barely pay any federal taxes to begin with -- their share of the cuts would be (slightly) disproportionately small (which is not the same as a tax increase, mind you). As for the middle income earners in quintiles two, three and four? They all get disproportionately large tax cuts, on average, compared to their share of federal taxes paid. As Edwards writes, this is precisely the opposite of what the Washington Post told its readers. The data above, incidentally, comes from the left-leaning Tax Policy Center; other nonpartisan groups have offered even rosier projections about the GOP\\'s plans, across an array of metrics. When a Twitter skirmish broke out over WaPo\\'s conclusions yesterday, the Manhattan Institute\\'s Brian Riedl (whose work I cited in this post) further underscored Edwards\\' correct argument:\\n\\nDerek -- Per TPC\\n\\n\\n\\n--Bottom 80% of families currently pay 33% of all combined federal taxes, yet would get 37% of the tax cuts.\\n\\n\\n\\n--Top 1% currently pays 27% of all federal taxes but would get just 18% of the tax cuts.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo tax code becomes MORE progressive. — Brian Riedl (@Brian_Riedl) December 11, 2017\\n\\n\\n\\nMight the Post\\'s in-house fact-checker care to assign some Pinocchios to their own paper\\'s misleading headline and reporting?

       " '1. Field of Invention\\nThis invention relates to integrated circuits and more particularly to delay circuits for use within CMOS integrated circuits.\\n2. Description of Related Art\\nIn integrated circuits there is a need to have a delay circuit to provide signal delays for various functions. Delay circuits can be found in internal clock generation for clock signals in a DRAM and in power supplies internal to semiconductor chips to control the timing of pump voltages. Setup and hold time is an important specification requiring the delay of signals for an asynchronous DRAM in controlling RAS, CAS, address and data and in a synchronous DRAM for producing the various clocks and controlling data and address.\\nIn U.S. Pat. No. 4,707,626 (Inoue) is shown a delay circuit for internal clock generation. This invention uses an RC network with a cross coupled nor gate as a single shot multivibrator. A MOS transistor is used as a resistor so that the resistance can vary with changes in the power supply and the capacitor is across the input of an inverter stage to vary the trip point with threshold voltage.\\nA power supply internal to an integrated circuit is discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,263,000 (Buskirk et al.) and uses an RC network in conjunction with a Schmitt trigger to produce a delay circuit to control a pump gate for supplying regulated power to the drains of flash EEPROM memory cells. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 5,511,026 (Cleveland et al.) shows a delay circuit using an RC network in conjunction with a Schmitt trigger for use with pump gates for an internal power supply providing power to the gates of a flash EEPROM memory cells.\\nIn all cases the delay circuits provide only one RC combination for use in any one delay circuit. Thus the delay of the rising and falling transitions of a signal are controlled with the same delay. A wide variation of rising and falling delays and differences in trigger points results in unbalanced signals. This makes it difficult to achieve set up and hold for all cases in the production of a product. A delay circuit with separate delay control of the rising and falling transitions is needed to overcome the wide variations in delay between rising and falling transitions.',\n",

The Rockies are going for a four game sweep. These Rockies were 18 games under .500 before this series started. They’d been on a 4 game losing streak and had scored 2 runs total in those four games. Today, they can sweep us in a four game series.—Aaron Cook is the Rockies’ best pitcher. He’s a lot better than Glendon Rusch and Jorge De La Rosa, who we scored 3 combined runs against. Cook pitched 3 Houdini-like innings late in the All Star game to keep it tied.—By comparison, Zach Duke starts for us. Duke’s been slowly falling away from the consistent, improved pitcher we were seeing at the start of the year. His last start was very bad and Coors Field is not an ideal place for him to pitch. However, he’s 2-0, 2.77 vs. the Rockies in his career. Go figure.—The Bucs need a win today (they haven’t won in a calendar week), but the ESPN.com/Accuscore prediction thing somehow has the Rox at a remarkable 69% favorite.

How is this\\nguy even famous?\\nThat’s how comedy in India works.\\nBut I recently realised that fame is very\\nimportant.\\nBecause 2 months back, my ex girlfriend messaged\\nme after two years.\\nAnd she asked me, “Hey Navin, so you do\\nstand up comedy now right?”\\nAnd I said, “Hey Lalitha, don’t you remember\\nyou broke up with me after watching my show?”\\nAnd she said, “Hey don’t remind me”\\nI said, “You don’t remind me!”\\nAnd then she asked me, “Navin, so do you\\nknow Kenny Sebastian?”\\nI said, “Yes I know Kenny Sebastian”\\nAnd that’s the point I realised that I don’t\\nlook like a person who knows Kenny Sebastian.\\nCos the next question she asked me was “So\\ndoes Kenny Sebastian know you?”\\nI said, “Yes he knows me”\\nThen she asked me, “So do you have Kenny\\nSebastian’s phone number?”\\nI said, “Yes I have his phone number”\\nAnd then she asked me, “So can you give\\nme his phone number?”\\nThis is the point I got carried away a little\\nbit.

       " 'An Indian Love Story\\n\\nAn Indian Love Story is a one-reel silent short film about personal relationships in a Native American community. The film is about two married couples, each of the partners of which are involved with the spouse of the other couple, a former lover. It is a western drama released in 1911 and directed by Fred J. Balshofer and was produced by Bison (a brand name under the New York Motion Picture Company). It was also titled An Indian Love Affair.\\n\\nThis film is one of the many films that claims to have utilized Native American actors, although Mona Darkfeather\\'s heritage is not entirely clear. The description of the story in Moving Picture World said that no white people appeared as characters in the story\\'s contest and didn\\'t clarify whether the cast included only Native Americans. Previously, Lillian St. Cyr, a Winnebago Indian, had appeared in Kalem\\'s The White Squaw and Lubin\\'s The Falling Arrow.\\n\\nPlot\\nAn Indian Love Story surrounds two couples who are in unhappy relationships. Two main characters, Deerheart and Mona (played by Mona Darkfeather), are partners. Another character, Dove Eye, is in love with Deerheart, even though Eagle Wing is hopelessly in love with her. A quadrangle is formed among the characters that are unhappy and dissatisfied with their relationships. The men fight for the women they desire through a series of events. Deerheart almost gets executed at the stake due to a misunderstanding by Dove Eye\\'s father. Dove Eye decides that because of the encounter with her father, she was never fit for Deerheart\\'s love. She then turns to Eagle Wing. Deerheart is released and is returned to Mona.\\n\\nCast \\n Mona Darkfeather - Mona\\n Dove Eye as Dove Eye - Mona\\'s Rival\\n Chief Eagle Wing as Eagle Wing - Dove Eye\\'s Admirer (as Eagle Wing)\\n\\nProduction\\nAn Indian Love Story was requested to be released early by the educational films corporation. The film is a western drama produced by Bison and released on August 18, 1911. The film is an integration of story, scenery, and Native American characters. A suggestion was made that the Native Americans were of Crow Indian descent and resided on their Wyoming reservation. But in 1911, Bison was in southern California and filmed this story in or near Los Angeles and used local actors from their own stock company. The film producers requested that the actors be as realistic as possible and be aware of Native American customs. It is unclear whether the cast consisted of only Indian actors. The film is one of the many early films about two Native American couples swapping partners.\\n\\nCasting\\nEven before An Indian Love Story, both Indian and white actors were cast to represent Native Americans in films. But Indians did not believe that the white actors reproduced the Indian lifestyle accurately and accused films of false portrayal of Indians. Native Americans protested and claimed that only Indians should play the roles of Indians. Bison\\'s Indian films occasionally consisted of Indian actors and their stories showed the \"noble savage and condemned the hostile warrior\", although they were not the only studio to do so.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nAleiss, Angela.

Rice allegedly answered the request with a \"Fuck off.\" Thompson is said to have responded by taking a swing at Rice, but he didn\\'t connect.\\n\\nRice told investigators he didn\\'t retaliate at that time, but he expressed umbrage at Thompson supposedly \"asking kids for money or drugs,\" the Sentinel reports.\\n\\nThen, on August 14, Rice was with his roommate when he saw Thompson outside a Chase bank not far from the intersection of East Quincy Avenue and South Buckley Road.

This means that an accident which is no fault of the owner, reduces the market value of the vehicle. A leased vehicle has to be repaired by the lessee, but when the vehicle is returned to the dealer, the reduced value on account of the accident is a cost to the lessor. Given the tailgating mentality of so many drivers, secure in the protection of no-fault insurance,  the leasing option is more attractive than the buying option as the market value drop in a vehicle damaged in an accident, is avoided.

Iranian proxies and Assad regime forces advanced south in the Syrian desert on Friday to reach the Syrian-Iraqi border, cutting off Free Syrian Army rebels who had hoped to traverse that same territory to fight ISIS in the east.\\n\\nBarring a Pentagon-backed rebel counterattack, Iranian proxies are now on pace to complete their corridor through a combination of advances south on the Iraqi side of the border and advances north and east on the Syrian side. On the Iraqi side, Iran-linked Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) groups reached the border in a lightning offensive last month. The Institute for the Study of War records that before the offensive, PMF groups had already attained a direct line of control from the Iran-Iraq border to Tel Afar – their forward position on the eve of the lightning offensive.\\n\\nNow, a similar lightning offensive has occurred on the Syrian side of the border. The Iranian pro-regime media station Tasnim News released multiple photos today from the Syrian-Iraqi border showing IRGC-Quds Force head Qassem Suleimani alongside members of the Fatimiyun Brigade, which is a force of Afghani foreign fighters in Syria backed by the IRGC. Iranian-backed militias from Iraq including the Imam Ali Battalions, the Imam Baqir Brigade, and the Jihad Brigades had all increased their presence in the Syrian desert in the weeks prior to last Friday’s advance.\\n\\nWhile many miles still separate the Iran-backed militias’ in northeastern Iraq and southwestern Syria, the militias are highly likely to link up if only ISIS-held territory stands in their way. Iranian and Assad regime forces were able to make rapid gains against ISIS in the Aleppo suburbs after boxing in rebel forces in the area of Al-Bab town. This past Friday, rebel forces in the Syrian desert might have been boxed in in a similar fashion.\\n\\nIt is important to note that pro-Assad forces launched few operations in the south Syrian desert until Free Syrian Army rebels began making gains against ISIS in the area this March and April. Assad forces then declared the area a priority – but they and their Iran-backed allies attacked the FSA rebels, not ISIS. Furthermore, pro-Assad attacks against rebel forces only began in earnest as the Russian “de-escalation zones” initiative took effect. Iranian Quds Force head Suleimani reportedly urged his proxies to build a ground corridor “before the Americans get there” around this time.\\n\\nShlomo Bolts is the policy and advocacy officer at the Syrian American Council in Washington D.C., where he prepares analysis and presentations regarding the ground situation inside Syria to facilitate policy papers, reports, op-eds and briefings with senior officials in the government and Congress.\\n\\n[Photo: Tasnim News]',\n",

       " 'Tumor promoting activity of teleocidin in skin and forestomach of mice initiated transplacentally with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene.\\nExperiments on the effect of transplacental initiation with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) and postnatal promotion with teleocidin were carried out in mice. The percentage of tumor-bearing mice among females treated with DMBA transplacentally on day 17 of gestation and postnatally by topical application of teleocidin to the skin of the back was 73.3% in week 30, whereas that among females treated with DMBA on day 10 of gestation and postnatally by topical application of teleocidin was 20.0%. This indicates that teleocidin shows potent tumor promoting activity on mouse skin in a transplacental initiation and postnatal promotion protocol. Furthermore, in the males treated with DMBA transplacentally on day 17 of gestation and given diet containing 0.01% teleocidin postnatally five tumors of the forestomach were found in 5 of 19 effective mice (26.3%) in week 52. One of these five tumors was a squamous cell carcinoma, and the others were papillomas. This indicates that teleocidin also has tumor promoting activity in the forestomach of mice.',\n",

We aimed to understand the attitudes, beliefs, preferences and values of patients who refused creation or use of an AVF. With qualitative methodology, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 HD patients (Canada, 2009), who previously refused creation or use of an AVF. Three independent analysts reviewed interview transcripts. We discovered three main themes that impacted the decision to refuse a fistula: (i) poor previous personal or vicarious experiences with the fistula, including cannulation, bleeding, time commitment and appearance; (ii) knowledge transfer and informed decision making. Patients identified information from other patients to be as important as information from health care workers, that information on vascular access (VA) was presented but not understood and that timing of information was crucial with information overload at the start of dialysis and (iii) maintenance of status quo and outlook on life. Some patients stated they live day-to-day without being influenced by the mortality risks with a catheter. AVF refusal is multifactorial and depends on individual patients. Although nephrologists consider the fistula to be the optimal VA, patients do not think in the same terms of reducing infection rates but focus on the practical day-to-day use of their VA and its influence on their quality of life and future outlook.',\n",

       " \"Surgical treatment of primitive thyroid lymphoma.\\nPrimitive thyroid lymphoma, although rare, is becoming more frequent. Its incidence is increasing, from 0.5% in the sixties to 1-5% of all thyroid neoplasms today. The diagnosis of such neoplasms is not always straightforward. In fact, it is often the result of pathologic findings on a gland resected for an apparently benign disease. Surgical dissection may prove more complicated than in standard cases of thyroidectomy for the possible tight adhesions existing between the gland's capsule and the surrounding structures. In cases of capsular infiltration, postoperative external local radiotherapy is indicated. A retrospective observational analysis was performed to establish whether patients with incidental thyroid lymphomas who underwent total thyroidectomy for another pathology had major surgical complications and worse prognostic results than patients with an accurate preoperative diagnosis. Six cases of thyroid lymphoma were retrospectively reviewed: 4 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and 2 MALT lymphomas. Of these, 2 were correctly preoperatively identified by fine-needle aspiration biopsy and 4 were an unexpected finding at histology: 3 cases of total thyroidectomy carried out for huge hypothyroid goiter in patients affected by Hashimoto's thyroiditis and in 1 case of total thyroidectomy carried out for anaplastic carcinoma in a patient affected by Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In our experience, a correct preoperative diagnosis was extremely difficult (33%). In patients who underwent fine-needle aspiration, a correct diagnosis was made in 66% of cases.

This appointment comes as Chris McWilton announced he will leave MasterCard on December 31.\\n\\nMcWilton joined MasterCard in 2003 as corporate controller and was appointed chief financial officer in October of the same year. As CFO, McWilton played a critical role in the company’s successful initial public offering (IPO) in May 2006. The MasterCard IPO was the largest domestic IPO of 2006 and the 12th largest domestic IPO in U.S. history at the time.\\n\\nHe was named president of MasterCard Global Accounts in 2007, managing relationships for the company’s largest customers. He was then appointed president of U.S. Markets in 2009, before assuming North American responsibilities in 2013.\\n\\nPrior to joining MasterCard, McWilton had a 22-year career with KPMG, where he specialized in financial and SEC reporting and was an SEC reviewing partner.\\n\\n“I want to acknowledge Chris’s contributions to the growth and evolution of MasterCard,” said Ajay Banga, president and chief executive officer, MasterCard. “I’d also like to personally thank him for his commitment over the years in helping to make our company what it is today. The entire company joins me in wishing Chris and his family all the best going forward.”\\n\\nAs president, North America Markets, Vosburg will oversee the company’s customer-facing activities in the United\\nStates and Canada, including sales, business development, strategy and relationship management with issuers, merchants, governments and acquirers. He will join the company’s Executive Committee.\\n\\nVosburg, 48, was most recently the company’s chief product officer, a role he held since April 1, 2014. In this role, he led the development, commercialization and management of the company’s global Core Products offerings which include consumer credit and debit, commercial, prepaid and loyalty solutions.\\n\\n“I’m pleased to announce Craig’s appointment. His experience, both global and domestic, make him the ideal person to drive our business forward,” said Banga. “I’m confident Craig will have great success in his new role.”\\n\\nVosburg brings global experience to the role gained through a decade of working in the Asia Pacific region with MasterCard and earlier in his career with Bain & Company and A.T. Kearney.\\n\\nVosburg joined MasterCard in 2006 as head of MasterCard Advisors in Southeast Asia, Greater China, and South Asia/Middle East/Africa. In 2008, he was named managing director of the MasterCard Advisors business in the U.S. and Canada. In 2010, Vosburg was named group executive, U.S. Market Development, responsible for managing and building relationships within the merchant and acquiring community.\\n\\nHe began his career working in commercial banking at CoreStates Financial Corporation.\\n\\nVosburg is a past David Rockefeller Fellow at the Partnership for New York City and currently sits on the Board of Directors of the New York Botanical Garden. He holds a Master of Business Administration from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from Bucknell University.\\n\\nChanges to Global Product and Middle East and Africa Leadership\\n\\nEffective January 1, Michael Miebach will assume the role of chief product officer for the company, replacing Vosburg, and will be based in New York. He currently serves as president, Middle East and Africa, responsible for driving the evolution of payments and delivering increased value to MasterCard stakeholders in markets across the region.\\n\\nBefore joining MasterCard in 2010, Miebach held several global positions including with Barclays, where he was the managing director for Middle East and North Africa and managing director for Barclays Africa.

Is there anything I can do (or in other words, what kind of external sources do I need?) to get my article back on Wikipedia? How can I get somebody that you define as reliable to verify that Westside, umm, exists? It just doesn't seem fair that I can't write an article about Westside just because the New York Times doesn't write about it. I thought the purpose of Wikipedia was to make information available to anyone who wants it. Several of Westside's readers have approached Wyatt (the co-creator) about a website to learn more about it, and, as of yet, he has no website to point them to. When he asked me to create a site about it (he's not great with these things) I of course immediately thought ``What better than Wikipedia?`` Unfortunately, I wasn't aware of the difficulty of putting a simple article up on Wikipedia. I won't deny that this has made me very angry. Is there ANY way for me to get my article back up? There's pretty much no chance that anything like a newspaper will cite Westside. Is there some kind of other source that I can get to review Westside? Also, why was my article initially cited as an attack article?

Duh, that's what happens in Discussion pages about religious denominations and political candidacies. Your action and your comments here are almost astute, but not quite: The article about Temple Lot was created by a member of the Temple Lot faction, Jared Smith, and and has been constructively edited by his older brother Jordan Smith, who is also an active member of the Temple Lot faction. Not a ``former member`` or an ``excommunicated`` member, but a full baptised member, ``in good standing`` according to the bylaws and official documentation both within and outside the faction. Due mainly to the machinations and malice of an anonymous editor, Good Ol'factory (whom you know perfectly well is the same as the Snocrates/Zoporific who began unconstructively editing the Temple Lot articles in December 2007), both Temle Lot members/Wikipedia Editors Jared Smith and Jordan Smith have been unfairly and abusively banned from editing Wikipedia. Specifically, Administrator Versageek banned Jordan Smith on December 17, 2007 because he kept complaining about Snocrates/Good Ol'factory's misconduct, and then when Snocrates-turned  Good Ol'factory was finally granted administrative privileges, he deleted jsmith51389's user page, which contained a clear explanation of what had happened in December 2007. Duh, that's what dishonest persons do, to hide their misconduct from review: they censor it. I'm mildly curious what pompous and unreasonable and unfair and abusive reply or action you will come up with in reply here, but I'm not terribly curious, seeing as how it's rather predictable whatever pompous, self-rightous ``authorities`` do when their misconduct is brought to light: Slander the person or persons who bring the misconduct to light, that's what they do.  Nice try, but no cigar, sir. The truth about the Latter-day Saint Movement, and the fascinating role Hedrickites such as Jared Smith and Jordan Smith have played in it, will come to light, whether you, or Snocrates/Good Ol'Factory or any other pious geek, wishes otherwise. Ironically, many issues played out on this discussion page in the past few days, and before, are issues which played out in the Free Speech Movement, I don't reckon you're familiar with that.

       " 'Apparently something went wrong. That can happen sometimes. The problem is that this always happens when I start a task that uses the GPU, for example start a 3d-game or play a video. Therefore I don\\'t think it is necessary for folding@home to stop working on the workunit and send back the unfinished work. I think it would work fine if, when something like this happens, folding@home would go back to the last saved state of the workunit and try again before giving it up. As long as I don\\'t start other applications that use the GPU, folding@home works fine, always. Also it always goes wrong when those applications are starting up, not while they are already running. That means there is nothing wrong with the work units. They can actually be finished. Gromacs can cantinue further. I think valuable work is being wasted by returning these work units unfinished, while they could have been finished if the client didn\\'t give it up so quickly.\\n\\nRight, your gpu is not able to do both high level calculations AND display 3d crap.

Looks like sometimes the GPU client can\\'t back off properly on your machine when something else needs the graphics card. I\\'m not sure how to fix this, but make sure your client and GPU drivers are up to date and everything should be fine. Pausing the client is a good idea.

You can\\'t expect me to know exactly how this high profile research program works.\\n\\nI\\'ve been folding gpu, since the nvidia client came out on my 8800gt... I know exactly what youre talking about. It still doesn\\'t change the fact that switching from on gpu process to another doesn\\'t cause a misstep in the calculations.\\n\\n1 misstep in a billion calculation still invalidates the results. 1 missstep in 250 gpu switches still screws up results. Theses safeties need to be there to protect the work being done.\\n\\nAs I understand his request, he is asking if the client shouldn\\'t retry the last frame after each failure, as sometimes the failure will not be repeated when running the frame again, probably due to environmental/circumstantial influences which caused the initial eue to happen. The problem with that request I think is the effectiveness of that solution, if all eue\\'s would run the last frame again, that\\'s also duplicate work, and since the system to check eue\\'s is now in place with reassigning the work unit to another donor replacing it with another one would need to be backed up by strong evidence of increased efficiency.\\n\\nIf you eue\\'d at a high percentage, there is something to be said for retrying the last frame, saving the time to get to that percentage on another donor\\'s system. But, time has shown that one particular system can eue at a fixed percentage when another will complete the unit without problems, reassigning the work unit to another donor stays a necessity therefore.\\n\\nI don\\'t want to dismiss the suggestion though, if there were abundant resources to spend on improving the clients and server code I would think it\\'s not a bad idea to retry a frame in certain conditions ( not the first frame for instance ) before returning it to Stanford with an eue report. Since the resources are limited, focus should be applied on things with the highest efficiency increases, I\\'m not sure where this would rank since it\\'s not a win win situation. In some/most cases, the frame would eue even when being repeated, waisting time before the wu is assigned to another donor, slowing the whole chain of generations.\\n\\nIf there is something with my computer that prevents a certain work unit from finishing no matter what, then the retry would still cost only a few minutes of extra work, compared to hours of extra work if it is sent to 2 other computers. I now understand what the downsides of this could be.\\n\\nI think it\\'s after all more efficient for me to not pause the client. If I paused the client every time that would easily make a difference of 4 less work units finished per day. That one work unit per week (or something like that) that crashes doesn\\'t make up for that.\\n\\nMany studies of the reliability of CPUs have been done and results published. One study of the reliability of GPUs was completed by Stanford and the paper was published. These are very important considerations needed to back up the computational methods used by FAH.\\n\\nStable computers will produce the same result if you give it the same set of calculations to be repeated. What you\\'re asking for is for science to accept results from unstable computers. No reputable scientist will trust results from unstable computers and as a consequence, Stanford does not condone/support overclocking. They can\\'t prevent you from doing it but they can insist that your hardware be inherently reliable.\\n\\nThey have no control over why your system fails, whether the failure was caused by bad hardware, by bad drivers, by overclocking, by a fault in some other program or by some unknown factor. They do have control over the results that are acceptable to their studies. The answer is pretty simple: bad results will be discarded.\\n\\nThe problem isn\\'t overclock... Its the gpu\\'s inability to perfectly switch from one graphics task to another. So unless Pande group starts making gpu\\'s, they have no control over the glitch.\\n\\nYou are wanting more efficiency, but what if youre idea happens. A gpu fails and restarts, but this btime the error isn\\'t caught. 2 months from now, the error is noticed. By then that minor glitch has propegated through the subsequent runs making all that work invalid and 2 wasted months of work. Where if the units dropped and resent to someone else, the project is not injepordy and an average of 2-3hrs is missed.\\n\\nIf youre all for science, this minor slow down is well worth the effect.\\n\\npatonb wrote:The problem isn\\'t overclock...

So unless Pande group starts making gpu\\'s, they have no control over the glitch.\\n\\nEven if we assume, as you have probably done, that the problem in inherent in the GPU\\'s hardware, it\\'s up to the drivers to resolve conflicts so I\\'d guess that someday a future version of the drivers will someday resolve this sort of issue. The fundamental problem is lack of repeatability, though, because those who write drivers are unlikely to ever see this failure in their testing.

The first month was challenging, and I started to doubt if my speaking out was the right thing. It had to be, staying silent for me was ugly and evil.

I also knew I had a few more cards to play, and I had nothing to lose.\\n\\nAfter a month, I put in my appeal of the termination.

A month into my battle plan, my money ran out.\\n\\nBelieve what you will, but I believe prayer works.\\n\\nThe next day, I got a phone call from another officer who had also experienced issues at the job. She informed me that the Prosecutor’s Office was doing a big investigation. By no means did enough heads roll, but they arrested a token few whose indiscretions were too much to conceal. Somebody was finally looking.\\n\\nExample: An inmate complained that she was being forced to have oral sex with an officer known to “hate inmates”. He denied it, then the inmate produced a Ziploc Baggie filled with his semen, not an easy find in an all female facility.\\n\\nWhile on the phone, the mailman came with one envelope from the Department of Justice, one from my attorney. The State of NJ wanted to settle my previous lawsuit (discrimination and harassment) and combine my suit into a Consent Decree. I’ll go into more detail in the “More Lemons Please!” book.

I went to a plus sized fashion convention, where I drew some attention. As I was looking at clothes, I was asked to try on different styles by one of the vendors. I ended up modeling at the convention including a line that is known as “fetish wear”. Actually, with the fetish wear, I got A LOT of attention. I found that I became adventurous going forward, and wow did I do it with a twist!\\n\\nLater on, I also helped run that clothing company and found it strikingly easy. There was a system in place and all I had to do was follow the system. I learned that there were skills I got from law enforcement that I could re-translate. Once I knew what those skills were and saw the pattern, I was no longer one-dimensional. I stopped being stressed when I realized a change in definitions revealed more about what I could do.

For some, the condom moment in a relationship is the first time ever a couple experiences flesh on flesh in the most private of areas. Go off condoms? Whaa? You mean I can stick my dick in there and come out alive?\\n\\nBut there comes a time in most serious relationships when you face an ethical and moral dilemma: to condom or not to condom. This usually happens when there’s a penis involved (most of my gals-who-like-gals pals admit to forgoing dental dams and other barriers).\\n\\nA few years ago, one of my colleagues suggested I write a column about deciding to drop condoms. As a columnist who strove to entertain and to promote safer sex, I politely declined. Besides, I always used condoms, silly! That was before my relationship got serious. Like pee-in-the-same-room serious.\\n\\nCouples have to have the maturity to switch back to condoms for a partner’s health/safetyBut now I know. Deciding to drop condoms marks a moment of trust in your partner…you trust that he won’t give you HIV, HPV, or the clap. You both have accurate and current test results, and you’re not lying about them either. If you’re a straight couple, the male half has to trust that she’s always going to be reliable us using her pill/ring/patch, because, for some, babies can be even worse than STIs.\\n\\nThere are gradients of safer sex, and sometimes condoms don’t factor into the safer sex you’re having. And that’s okay as long as you’ve got your bases covered.\\n\\n1. Some form and extent of exclusivity\\n2. STI testing, with presumably acceptable results\\n3. Certain length of time together, which varies\\n4. Reliable contraception for hetero couplings\\n\\nIt’s hard for these younger types (i.e. people like me) to accept that condomless sex is not morally wrong. I already feel like I’m treading in deplorable sex column behavior here. I’m endangering the public good!\\n\\nBut, as I previously mentioned, it all boils down to trust. A trust in healthy sex.\\n\\nWith condoms as effective in preventing unwanted pregnancies and transmission of certain STIs as they are, it’s a privilege for couples to step back to au naturel. You’ve got to plan and perhaps pay extra for birth control. It takes an incredible amount of responsibility to carefully cross the condomless border because–let’s face it–not everyone can do it or do it right. Most importantly, couples have to have the maturity to switch back to condoms because of a contraceptive misstep or simply for a partner’s sanity/health/safety.\\n\\nSo, sure, use a condom every time. But if this time is your 60th time with your longterm partner and neither of you is boning anyone else etc. etc., maybe you don’t have to drop a buck every time you f–ahem, engage in coitus.',\n",

The Marines were in town with other members of their helicopter unit in order to attend a local Marine event.\\n\\nKeenan began to ask them if they were “proud,” eventually asking “are you Proud Boys?” Godinez recalled responding simply “We are Marines.” According to their testimony, this is when the situation escalated into assault. The U.S. Marine reservists were allegedly attacked by Keenan, Massey, and a group of roughly a dozen others chanting “fuck him up.”\\n\\nThe soldiers were allegedly called white supremacists and Nazis. When Godinez cried out that he was Mexican, the jeering reportedly turned to racial slurs like “spic” and “wetback.” According to his testimony, “The best way I can describe it is the sound of people chanting in a soccer stadium,” adding that Keenan was “laughing, smiling, and having a good time, while I could have died that day.”\\n\\nThe judge ruled that both men would be held for trial on felony charges of aggravated assault and conspiracy, along with several misdemeanors. This will be far from Keenan’s first time in legal jeopardy. As part of the “Love Park 4,” Keenan was charged with criminal conspiracy, institutional vandalism, resisting arrest, and criminal mischief.\\n\\nAt the time, Keenan only pleaded guilty to “disorderly conduct,” and the remaining charges were withdrawn.

Voter Fraud is more likely to be offsetting ... close to an equal number voting illegally for each party and not likely to effect the outcome of elections.\\nElection Fraud, on the other hand, can effect a much larger number of votes, in the tens of millions. Election Fraud may involve any or all of the following: tampering with election machines that enter and/or tally the votes, voter suppression tactics such as caging and purging that can disenfranchise millions of voters, gerrymandering, provisional ballots that never get counted, and tactics to make voting and/or registration harder.\\nElection Fraud can determine election outcomes.\",\n",

It also seems to afflict teachers more often due to their exposure to hundreds of students a day. It is also known to afflict neocons like Larry Craig while in public bathrooms, and give them \"Happy Feet\". It is also known a GAIDS, GayAIDS, or the Gay Virus. Anyone who gets infected with it becomes GAY GAY GAY GAY!\\n\\nContents\\n\\nSymptoms\\n\\nThe first sign of Getting Some Sick is Getting Some Nausea. Vomiting typically does not accompany the nausea, but in rare cases patients were Blowing Some Chunks.\\nThe second sign is Getting Some Migraine. This includes sensitivity to light, sound, and common sense. Typically the pain is felt in the temple area.\\nThe final and most elusive sign of Getting Some Sick is Getting Some Delirium. Patients typically experience hallucination, which leads to word salad. The only problem with this is that sometimes the patients are just weird.\\nOther symptoms include nausea, heartburn, indigestion, upset stomach, diarrhea. After that the person infected with it becomes GAY GAY GAY GAY!\\n\\nDocumented Cases\\n\\nA manifestation of some sick.\\n\\nThe first documented case of Get Some Sick is that of Mr. Winkler, a seventh-grade teacher. He assigned students a reference book to read dealing with homosexuality, and one child refused to read it. Winkler had no choice but to fail the student. Unbeknownst to him, the child was a master of voodoo and had political ties with the Ku Klux Klan which later provided him with the reaserch on the Get Some Sick Virus, and he willed the illness upon Winkler.\\nIt took four doctors 42 hours to find out what was wrong with him, but finally they Got Some Germ and discovered a new type of archebacteria in Winkler\\'s testicle. They were able to administer a new type of antibiotic to cure him of the condition. It was first discovered by Dr. House after he confused it for Lupus.\\n\\nThe second documented case of Get Some Sick is that of Larry Craig who caught it in an airport public bathroom and forgot his antibiotic shots and started to have \"Happy Feet\" and was accused of being Gay by an undercover Police Officer in the stall next to his. Larry Craig is still in denial about this.\\n\\nCures\\n\\nA vaccine has been created for the illness, in the form of Getting Some Shot In The Arm With A Really Huge Needle. The patient must be injected with the vaccine in the upper arm with a 14-inch needle. Do not be alarmed when it goes clear through his/her arm- this is normal.

Won\\'t that hurt genetic diversity?\\n\\nWhat do packs and pack-members in adjacent ranges do when one wipes out neighboring competitors? \\n\\nIf there is an overabundance of ungulates, and no control by predators, what limits their population growth? \\n\\nWhat\\'s all this hooey about ecological niches anyway? \\n\\nCan killing an entire wolf pack really \"almost immediately\" boost a caribou population in danger of extinction? What if the wolves aren\\'t providing the bulk of the predatory pressure? Or is wolf/caribou interactions the only variable controlling caribou population size? \\n\\nI patiently await your response, and look forward to learning something.',\n",

    "A much more nuanced way to represent text is through embeddings. However, most machine learning models require a fixed-size input, so we need to find a way to represent the whole document as a fixed-size vector. One way to do this is to use the average of the word embeddings of the words in the document. We will use the pre-trained word embeddings from the GloVe model. However, using word embeddings requires us to split the documents into individual words. We will use the nltk library to do this, but there are both simpler and more advanced ways to do this. The simplest method would be to split the documents by spaces, while a more advanced method would be to use a tokenizer that is aware of the structure of the language, like the one in the [spacy](https://spacy.io/api/tokenizer) library."
